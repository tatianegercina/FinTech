### 18. Instructor Do: Upcoming Upgrades (10 mins)

**Files:**

* [slides x-y]()

Navigate to the Upcoming Upgrades section of the slide deck and discuss future upgrades in store for Ethereum:

* Sharding - The network will be able to split into separate geographical regions, meaning that the blockchain can be split up
  without sacrificing security. This will enable a significant increase in transaction speed and a decrease in resources needed to run.

* Proof of Stake - This new algorithm will remove the mining process entirely, allowing many more users to participate in securing the network
  without wasting electricity.

* Zero Knowledge Proofs - This technology will allow for private transactions on a public network, opening up more possibilities for enterprise adoption.

* Layer 2 scaling - The Raiden and Plasma networks are being built to support Ethereum by offloading many transactions to a second-layer network built
  on top of the main Ethereum network. This will allow for extremely cheap, near instantaneous transactions.

* More programming language options - eWASM is being built in order to allow for other languages to compile into Ethereum's runtime.
