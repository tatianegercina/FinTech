Walk through the solution and highlight the following:

* Stablecoins are tokens created on the blockchain that represent some form of underlying asset.

* They are tokens designed to represent fiat currency at a 1:1 ratio

* They help the adoption of blockchain without the price volatility associated with other cryptocurrencies.

* Stablecoins can be backed by different types of underlying assets.

* The first is fiat-collateralized where the coin is backed by fiat, government currency.

Ask the class: "Have you heard of any fiat-collateralized stablecoins, if so which ones?"

  * **Answer**: Tether's USDT

  * **Answer**: Gemini's "Gemini Dollar" (GUSD)

  * **Answer**: Circle's "USD Coin" (USDC)

  * **Answer**: Paxos

* The second is crypto-collateralized, where smart contracts manage the exchange rate between crypto and the stablecoin
  in order to maintain parity with the fiat currency.

Ask the class if they have heard of any crypto-collateralized stablecoins, and if so, which:

  * **Answer**: MakerDai (DAI) -- The most popular. Dai is pegged to the US Dollar, and the stablecoin itself is backed by Ether.

  * **Answer**: Synthetix (nUSD)

* Another option is commodity-collateralized, where non-liquid assets are used to back the stablecoin.
  Normally this includes assets like gold and silver, but Venezuela created "Petrocoin" which is supposedly backed
  one coin to one barrel. However, Petrocoin has failed to gain recognition as a legitimate cryptocurrency.

Ask the class: "What might be a benefit of creating a gold-backed cryptocurrency?"

  * **Answer**: Much easier to send crypto than to ship gold.

  * **Answer**: Can liquidize the gold market more.

  * **Answer**: Can create a currency based on the gold standard again.

* The last, least common and most difficult to implement is purely algorithmic stablecoins that are not
  collateralized by any asset, but rather the price is determined by an algorithm that adjusts the coin supply
  against market capitalization to create a stable reference value. This is also called Seigniorage-style.
