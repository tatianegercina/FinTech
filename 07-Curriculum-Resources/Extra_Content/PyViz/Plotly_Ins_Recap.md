In this activity, students recap the knowledge and skills learned during the day. Students can ask questions, or he instructor can ask guided questions to facilitate the recap.

**Files:**

* [Slides]()

Congratulate students on taking their plotting skills to the next level. Communicate the following:

* **Plotly Express** is a technology commonly used by data scientists and programmers for data visualization needs.

* Plotly is incredibly versatile and supports multiple programming languages (i.e. R, JavaScript, Python). This makes it highly desired skill by employers.

Ask students if they have any questions about the material covered in today's lesson.

* Use this time to answer as many questions as possible.

* Once time is up, encourage students to attend office hours or reach out to the TAs if they have any additional questions.

If students do not have any questions, ask them the following guided questions:

* Ask students to summarize some of the differences between hvPlot and **Plotly Express**.

  * **Answer** hvPlot offers an easy way to overlay/compose plots. **Plotly Express** offers parallel categories and coordinate plots. **Plotly Express** also has integration with Mapbox API.

Communicate to students that the visualizations they've created so far, and their notebooks in general, could be viewed as reports that provide or answer a specific  request for information or data need. Another type of visualization is a dashboard.

* If reports are different than dashboards, what is a dashboard?

  * **Answer** A dashboard is an interactive visualization tool that can be dynamically manipulated to show data.

* What makes a dashboard starkly different than a report?

  * **Answer** Dashboards often contain live data rather than static data (like with a report). This allows data to be real time. Dashboards are also sometimes made up of multiple reports.

  * **Answer** Reports provide a view into raw data. Reports help visualize underlying data and spot trends. Dashboards present data within a specific context/reporting agenda, and the data is often curated to report on specific KPIs.
