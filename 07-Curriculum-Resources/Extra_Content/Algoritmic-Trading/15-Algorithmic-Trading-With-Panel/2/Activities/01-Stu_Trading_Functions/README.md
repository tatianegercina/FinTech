# Trading Functions

Tony, an aspiring trader, wants to invest in the stock market. While his colleagues and friends are advising Tony to invest in a mutual fund and hold it for the long term, he is fascinated with short-term market swings and wants to profit off of such market fluctuations. Unfortunately for Tony, he has a 9 to 5 day job and is unable to constantly track his short-term investments. One night, while thinking of how to maximize his profits while minimizing risk, he has an epiphany and realizes he needs to create JARVIS (Just Another Research Visualization and Investment Service) to monitor his investments *for* him. Tony sits down to brainstorm what operations JARVIS should perform. 

Help Tony decide what the correct order of the functions below should be called, and why.

## Instructions

Open the [unsolved file](Unsolved/jarvis.py) and complete the `main()` function by calling each function below in an order that might make a trade:

* evaluate_metrics()

* generate_signal()

* fetch_data()

* build_dashboard()

* update_dashboard()

* execute_backtest()

* initialize()

* execute_trade_strategy()

### Hints

Imagine that each function had complete code and the data was all connected. Which order would make it possible to make a complete trade?
