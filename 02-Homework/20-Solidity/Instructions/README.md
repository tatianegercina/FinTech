## Background

Your new startup has created its own Ethereum-compatible blockchain to help connect financial institutions, and the team wants to build smart contracts to automate some company finances to make everyone's lives easier, increase transparency, and to make accounting and auditing practically automatic!

Fortunately, you've been learning how to program smart contracts with Solidity! What you will be doing this assignment is creating a few `ProfitSplitter` contracts. These contracts will do several things:

* Pay your Associate-level employees quickly and easily.

* Distribute profits to different tiers of employees.

* Distribute company shares for employees in a "deferred equity incentive plan" automatically.

You will deploy the contracts to an Ethereum testnet, like Kovan, so the team can test them out before moving to production.

## Files

* [`AssociateProfitSplitter.sol`](Starter-Code/ProfitSplitter.sol) -- Level 1 starter code.

* [`TieredProfitSplitter.sol`](Starter-Code/TieredProfitSplitter.sol) -- Level 2 starter code.

* [`DeferredEquityPlan.sol`](Starter-Code/DeferredIncentivePlan.sol) -- Level 3 starter code.

## Instructions

This assignment has 3 levels of difficulty, with each contract increasing in complexity and capability. Start with Level 1, then move forward as you complete the challenges. You can build all three with the skills you already have!

* **Level One** is an `AssociateProfitSplitter` contract. This will accept Ether into the contract and divide the Ether evenly among the associate level employees. This will allow the Human Resources department to pay employees quickly and efficiently.

* **Level Two** is a `TieredProfitSplitter` that will distribute different percentages of incoming Ether to employees at different tiers/levels. For example, the CEO gets paid 50%, CTO 45%, and Bob gets 5%.

* **Level Three** is a `DeferredEquityPlan` that models traditional company stock plans. This contract will automatically manage 1000 shares with an annual distribution of 250 over 4 years for a single employee.

### Starting your project

Navigate to the [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org) and create a new contract called `ProfitSplitter.sol` using the starter code above.

While developing and testing your contract, use the [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) development chain, and point MetaMask to `localhost:8545`, or replace the port with what you have set in your workspace.

### Level One: The `AssociateProfitSplitter` Contract

At the top of your contract, you will need to define the following `public` variables:

* `employee_one` -- The `address` of the first employee. Make sure to set this to `payable`.

* `employee_two` -- Another `address payable` that represents the second employee.

* `employee_three` -- The third `address payable` that represents the third employee.

Create a constructor function that accepts:

* `address payable _one`

* `address payable _two`

* `address payable _three`

Within the constructor, set the employee addresses to equal the parameter values. This will allow you to avoid hardcoding the employee addresses.

Next, create the following functions:

* `balance` -- This function should be set to `public view returns(uint)`, and must return the contract's current balance. Since we should always be sending Ether to the beneficiaries, this function should always return `0`. If it does not, the `deposit` function is not handling remainders properly and should be fixed. This will serve as a test function of sorts.

* `deposit` -- This function should set to `public payable` check ensuring that only the owner can call the function.

  * In this function, perform the following steps:

    * Set a `uint amount` to equal `msg.value / 3;` in order to calculate the split value of the Ether.

    * Transfer the `amount` to `employee_one`.

    * Repeat the steps for `employee_two` and `employee_three`.

    * Since `uint` only contains positive whole numbers, and Solidity does not fully support float/decimals, we must deal with a potential remainder at the end of this function, since `amount` will discard the remainder during division.

    * We may either have `1` or `2` wei leftover, so transfer the `msg.value - amount * 3` back to `msg.sender`. This will re-multiply the `amount` by 3, then subtract it from the `msg.value` to account for any leftover wei, and send it back to Human Resources.

* Create a fallback function using `function() external payable`, and call the `deposit` function from within it. This will ensure that the logic in `deposit` executes if Ether is sent directly to the contract. This is important to prevent Ether from being locked in the contract, since we don't have a `withdraw` function in this use-case.

#### Test the contract

In the `Deploy` tab in Remix, deploy the contract to your local Ganache chain by connecting to `Injected Web3` and ensuring MetaMask is pointed to `localhost:8545`.

You will need to fill in the constructor parameters with your designated `employee` addresses.

Test the `deposit` function by sending various values. Keep an eye on the `employee` balances as you send different amounts of Ether to the contract and ensure the logic is executing properly.

### Level Two: The `TieredProfitSplitter` Contract

In this contract, rather than splitting the profits between Associate-level employees, you will calculate rudimentary percentages for different tiers of employees (CEO, CTO, and Bob).

Using the starter code, within the `deposit` function, perform the following:

* Calculate the number of points/units by dividing `msg.value` by `100`. This will allow us to multiply the points with a number representing a percentage. For example, `points * 80` will output a number that is ~80% of the `msg.value`.

* Set the `amount` to equal the number of `points` multiplied by the percentage (say, 60 for 60%).

* Add the `amount` to the `total` to keep a running total of how much of the `msg.value` we are distributing so far.

* Then, transfer the `amount` to `employee_one`. Repeat the steps for each employee, setting the `amount` to equal the `points` multiplied by their given percentage.

* For example, each transfer should look something like the following for each employee, until after transferring to the third employee:

  * Step 1: `amount = points * 80;`

  * Step 2: `total += amount;`

  * Step 3: `employee_one.transfer(amount);`

* Send the remainder to the employee with the highest percentage by subtracting `total` from `msg.value`, and sending that to an employee.

* Deploy and test the contract functionality by depositing various Ether values (greater than 100 wei).

  * Note: The 100 wei threshold is due to the way we calculate the points. If we send less than 100 wei, for example, 80 wei, `points` would equal `0` because `80 / 100` equals `0` because the remainder is discarded. We will learn more advanced arbitrary precision division later in the course. In this case, we can disregard the threshold as 100 wei is a significantly smaller value than the Ether or Gwei units that are far more commonly used.

### Level Three: The `DeferredEquityPlan` Contract



### Deploy the contracts to a live Testnet

Once you feel comfortable with your contracts, point MetaMask to the Kovan or Ropsten network. Ensure you have test Ether on this network!

After switching MetaMask to Kovan, simply deploy the contract as before and keep note of the deployed addresses. The transaction will also be in your MetaMask history, and on the blockchain permanently to explore later.

## Submission

Create a `README.md` that explains what testnet the contract is on, the motivation for the contract.

Upload this to a Github repository that explains how the contract works, and provide the testnet address for others to be able to send to.
