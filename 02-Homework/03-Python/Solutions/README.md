## Background

Welcome to Ichiraku Ramen! Opening up a ramen shop has always been your dream and it's finally been realized --- you're closing out on your second year of sales!
Like last year, you need to analyze your business' financial performance by cross-referencing your sales data with your internal menu data to figure out revenues
and costs for the year. This year, you also want to analyze how well your business did on a per product basis (as you have several choices of ramen) in order to 
better understand what products are doing well, poorly, and ultimately which products should potentially be removed or changed. You tried doing this type of per
product analysis last year in Excel, but doing so required a lot of manual intervention and frankly is not as kept up-to-date as it should be.

Therefore, the necessity requires innovation.

Business has been doing well but 


 You're a budding entrepreneur closing out your first year of business and you need to total up your sales to generate your income statement for the year.
However, 


Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.

To help process this data, you will create machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset.

In this homework assignment, you will need to:

1. [Preprocess the raw data](#Preprocessing)
2. [Tune the models](#Tune-Model-Parameters)
3. [Compare two or more models](#Evaluate-Model-Performance)

## Instructions

### Preprocess the Data

* Preprocess the raw dataset prior to fitting the model.
* Perform feature selection and remove unnecessary features.
* Use `MinMaxScaler` to scale the numerical data.
* Separate the data into training and testing data.

### Tune Model Parameters

* Use `GridSearch` to tune model parameters.
* Tune and compare at least two different classifiers.

### Evaluate Model Performance

Compare the performance of two or more classifiers to determine the best model performance.

## Hints and Considerations

* Start by cleaning the data, removing unecessary columns, and scaling the data.

* Try a simple model first, and then tune the model using `GridSearch`.

## Submission

* Create a Jupyter Notebook and host the notebook on GitHub.

* Include a README.md file that summarizes your assumptions and findings.

* Submit the link to your GitHub project to Bootcamp Spot.
