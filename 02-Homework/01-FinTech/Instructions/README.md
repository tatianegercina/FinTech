## Background

As a FinTech professional, it is critical to learn how FinTech companies start, evolve, and grow, and to be able to speak knowledgeably about the major players in the Fintech space. Even those in a highly technical role must stay abreast of what is happening in the business landscape - this is partially because many FinTech companies create tools and technologies which are then used by other companies.

“Case Studies” are one of the major methods of corporate analysis used in top business schools. While full business school case studies may be 50-100 pages long or more, your case study will be more focused: specifically, it will be an analysis of how a FinTech company of your choice is responding to the problems and needs of the FinTech domain it is in, and how it is using technology to solve a standing financial problem.

In this homework assignment, you will:
1. Select a Fintech domain that interests you.
2. Select a company or project within that domain
3. Research the domain and company.
4. Write a detailed case study of the company.
5. Prepare and deliver a short presentation of your case study to the class the following week.
6. Upload your case study as a Git repository.

This assignment will challenge you to polish your FinTech research skills by accessing the industry reports, popular publications and online resources that FinTech professionals use to evaluate the industry. It will also allow you to situate the techniques and technologies you will be mastering in this course - Machine Learning, Python, Modeling, Blockchain - in the real world of global FinTech, and to practice presenting and speaking about FinTech strategy and technology.

### Instructions

#### 1. Choose a FinTech domain that you find relevant or interesting

* Note: We covered a number of FinTech domains in class this week. If you already have a company in mind that you want to research, skip directly to step 3.

* Payments/Billing
* Capital Investment
* Investment Management
* Wealth Management
* Enterprise Solutions
* Insurance (InsurTech)
* Mortgage/Real Estate
* Personal Finance/Deposits/Online Banking
* Lending
* Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies
* Regulation Technology (RegTech)
* Open Banking
* Roboadvising

* Note that FinTech is such an emerging field that different FinTech reports sometimes use different names and definitions of Fintech domains and sectors (CB Insights, Investopedia, Accenture). You may see lists of FinTech domains online that are either longer or shorter than the list above; there is no one comprehensive list.


#### 2. Choose a company (or project) within your Fintech domain

Use online research to identify the trends in your domain and choose a company that is successful or otherwise interesting to you. If you have chosen “Wealth Management,” you might want to look at online journals, periodicals, reports and websites about the future of Wealth Management, or how FinTech is changing or disrupting Wealth Management.

Your company could be:

* A new FinTech company that has emerged and is doing very well in a particular domain (Examples include: Square, Plaid, Lemonade, RobinHood, Coinbase)

* A large incumbent financial or technology company that is doing something interesting and new with technology (Examples include: Goldman Sachs’ Marcus, JP Morgan’s JPMCoin, Facebook Libra, Apple Card)

* A smaller startup that is not yet wildly successful, but you find promising and interesting. This may include a FinTech company in your local area or a company with a new idea that you would like to learn more about.

#### 3. Research, Using the Case Study Template as your Guide

We recommend that you focus your research by using the case study template below. You may lengthen, shorten, or, if necessary, remove sections of the template to accommodate the public information available about your company.

Note: If you have chosen a project within a larger company (such as the Apple Credit Card), you may want to focus your research on the origins and scope of the project, rather than the company itself.

CASE STUDY TEMPLATE:
```
# TITLE

## Overview and Origins

* Name of company

* When was the company incorporated?

* Who are the founders of the company?

* How did this idea come about?

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?


## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company/project trying to solve?

* Who is the intended customer of the company? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

* Which technologies are they currently using and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing- you may want to search the company’s engineering blog, or use sites like Stackshare)


## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company In

* What are the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

* Who are the other major companies in this domain?


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company doing on these metrics?

* How is your company doing relative to competitors in the same domain?


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they add to their services (whether another company already has them or something that is your pure imagination)?

* Why do you think it would benefit them?

* What technologies would your proposed ideas incorporate?

* Why are those technologies appropriate for your solution?
```

## 4. Write the case study

Write the finished case study as a markdown `README.md` report that uses the Case Study Template provided. The finished case study is likely to be between 5-8 pages long to accommodate all the relevant information.

Be sure to cite your sources! List any websites, podcasts, blogs, or articles that you accessed and provide links to the sources that you used to research the domain and the company. This does not have to be an official works cited page, but your sources must be included as an addendum to the case study on the final page.

## 5. Present your findings to the class

Create a very short slideshow that synopsizes the information in your case study for an in-class presentation. Your presentation should be no more than 5 minutes. Plan on having 1-2 slides for each of the 5 sections of the template.

## 6. Upload your case study as a Git repository

We also studied some technical aspects of FinTech this week, including how to set up and populate a Git repository. As a final step, take your finished case study and upload it into a repository to share with the instructor and class.
