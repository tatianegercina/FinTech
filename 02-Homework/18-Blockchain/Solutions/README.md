# PupperNet, an out-of-the-box blockchain

In this tutorial, I will demonstrate using `geth`, the official Ethereum client, how to run a PupperNet private network.

This network is configured for `5 seconds` block times and uses the Clique Proof of Authority consensus algorithm. This
will ensure fast and efficient testing, so no need to worry about your CPU. The chain ID is `333`.

The sealer node addresses are:

`0xd84d79a0069fb5d3cf8eca3c689f231d6b603c8f`
`0x7a4f862ab163fc62dce2cfbb734ddac153c5e8cc`

The account password for both nodes is `testnetpassword`

This is the configuration from `puppeth`:

## Install the geth node software

Download and install `geth` for your operating system here: <https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/>

## Install the MyCrypto GUI wallet

Download and install the desktop version of the MyCrypto wallet here: <https://download.mycrypto.com/>

This wallet allows communicating with custom networks, which we will configure later.

## Run the first node and enable the mining/sealing

`geth --datadir node1 --unlock "d84d79a0069fb5d3cf8eca3c689f231d6b603c8f" --mine --rpc`

We enable the `--rpc` flag on the first node to talk to it later. This defaults to port `8545`.
We need to unlock the node's account to enable it to sign blocks.

## Copy the enode address from this node

For example:
`enode://b044f481e52f03950ed88ad18f550ace268ad4e4e1647f80c5808d6ea2c4e7f550d8ed25a14608afa6e5828f1b69fdfcf5d7775394f7c38d8592f600e4a37e90@127.0.0.1:30303`

## Use the first node's enode address as the bootnode for the second node and run on a separate port

`geth --datadir node2 --unlock "7a4f862ab163fc62dce2cfbb734ddac153c5e8cc" --mine --port 30304 --bootnodes enode://b044f481e52f03950ed88ad18f550ace268ad4e4e1647f80c5808d6ea2c4e7f550d8ed25a14608afa6e5828f1b69fdfcf5d7775394f7c38d8592f600e4a37e90@127.0.0.1:30303`

Using the first node as a bootnode will enable the nodes to communicate with each other and discover new nodes later.

## Success!

You should now be mining/sealing blocks using the Proof of Authority algorithm! Now it's time to send a transaction.

## Send a test transaction

Open up MyCrypto and select `Change network` at the bottom left.

Select `Add Custom Node` and use `127.0.0.1:8545` to connect to the first node, add a name, use chain ID `333` and save.

Your configuration should look like this:

You should now be connected to the local blockchain.

Click on the `Keystore file` option to access the first node's wallet, and navigate to `node1/keystore` and select
the keystore file, then enter `testnetpassword` as the password.

You should now be able to send a transaction. Fill in the second node's account and send it one ETH.

Once confirmed, you can check the TX Status by clicking the button in the popup, or pasting the TX Hash into the TX Status section of the app.

Voila! You can now use the PupperNet blockchain for your local development!
