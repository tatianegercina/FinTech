# Case Study Proposal: TokenFunder

## What Is It

TokenFunder is a Toronto-based FinTech company that uses Ethereum blockchain technology to create a platform in which companies can raise venture capital from everyday investors; TokenFunder's platform is used as a digital asset marketplace that helps private companies raise capital by offering digital securities, known as security tokens, to investors through initial coin offerings (ICO) or initial token offerings (ITO) that are legally compliant with Canadian law. These digital securities can then be traded on TokenFunder's blockchain-powered platform by both retail and accredited investors alike.

TokenFunder is designed as a mobile investing and trading platform that creates non-custodial wallets rather than custodial wallets, which provide users individual access to their funds rather than through a third-party vendor that controls the wallet private keys, and is heavily focused on ensuring investor rights are protected with proper regulatory compliance and governance.

In 2017, the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) approved TokenFunder's ICO, making TokenFunder the first regulatory-approved issuer of digital securities in Canada. Then in 2020, TokenFunder's affiliate, TokenGX, became the first Canadian company to build a regulatory-approved secondary trading marketplace for digital securities.

## Why This Matters

In traditional financial markets, new companies or start-ups usually go through private venture capital channels to raise capital, while more established companies may instead undergo an initial public offering (IPO) to raise capital from investors via the public markets. In contrast, TokenFunder's vision of creating a digital securities marketplace allows both retail investors and institutional investors alike to invest in start-up companies via digital tokens that can also be traded amongst other investors. Therefore, TokenFunder's vision will help to increase start up companies' ability to raise capital from the everyday investor as well as bolster investors' ability to invest in new companies that they may not have been able to before.

## Why This May be Interesting

TokenFunder is on the precipice of changing the game when it comes to providing access to digital financial markets. Not only was TokenFunder the first to be regulator-approved by the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) for its Initial Coin Offering (ICO), but also was the first to be regulatory-approved for its vision of creating a secondary marketplace for exchanging digital securities through its affiliate TokenGX. TokenFunder could potentially create a vast, secure, and regulatory compliant ecosystem for private companies to raise capital as well as allowing investors to trade digital securities of these private companies. Thus, TokenFunder could become a big name player in the Canadian digital finance space.
