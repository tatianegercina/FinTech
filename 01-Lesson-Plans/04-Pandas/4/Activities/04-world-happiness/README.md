# World Happiness

## Instructions

In this exercise we will be looking at the World Happiness report for 2017. It includes the happiness score of every country in relation to various contributing factors such as economic production (GDP) and life expenctancy. This is a chance to use what you have learned in class so far and get more practice working with pandas. You are expected to be able to sort and filter the data based on given parameters. This exercise will go over

* setting a new index for the dataframe
* navigating through dataframe using `loc` and `iloc`
* locating a specific data value
* filtering and slicing specific rows of data
* creating new tables based on specific columns
* filtering data based on a specific condition
* filtering data based on multiple conditions

The exercise is meant to, hopefully, be somewhat challenging. If you get stuck look towards your in class activities! Some of the more challenging parts might require methods that have not been covered yet or only briefly touched on so practice your Google-Fu and start looking things up!

The data set for this is actually quite interesting. Does money buy happiness? Do happy people live longer? I guess you'll find that out and more! Good luck and have fun with this one!
