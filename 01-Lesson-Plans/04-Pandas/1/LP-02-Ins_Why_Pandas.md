### 2. Instructor Do: why Pandas (5 mins)

**Files:**

* [Unit 4.1 Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OyHSaY2IlRT7ncexJgjimA7zulBWV67_Pr5XdS6kyYQ/edit?usp=sharing)

Open the slides and start talking about how awesome spreadsheets are (slide 4).

> "Since spreadsheets appeared in [1969 when LANPAR was first used by the plant budgeting operations of AT&T](http://www.renepardo.com/), through [VisiCalc in 1970](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VisiCalc) to [Microsoft Excel in 1987](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel), they transformed the finance and quants analysis forever; however as more data became available and complexity increased, not everything is what it used to be."

Open the discussion (slides 5 and 6) by questioning the class about the pain points they have suffered themselves while dealing the data using a spreadsheet.

You can start a collaborative document on Google Drive to allow students to share their experiences, you can keep this document as a time capsule to be opened at the end of the unit to assess what they have learned and how they can overcome now those pain points using Pandas.

Use the rest of the presentation to introduce Pandas as the light at the end of a dark tunnel, like a beautiful oasis in the middle of the desert, let them know and get exited about the infinite possibilities Pandas will offer them for data analysis as FinTech professionals. Remember to remark that Pandas has its origins on the financial realm.

If there is time, you can end the discussion by presenting some of the applications that Pandas has on different business areas like the ones [discussed here](https://data-flair.training/blogs/applications-of-pandas/).
