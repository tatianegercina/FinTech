# Game of Thrones: Pandas Are Coming

> When you play the Game of Thrones you win or you die.

## Instructions

In this exercise, we will be analyzing character deaths in Game of Thrones.

You will be able to flex your newly found Pandas skills and masterfully navigate and filter through the dataset. Specific to this exercise you will get practice with:

* Creating a new table from the existing dataset.
* Grouping data based on a specific column.
* Sorting the data and reseting the index.
* Filtering data based on multiple conditions.

The exercise is meant to, hopefully, be somewhat challenging. If you get stuck, look at your in-class activities. Some of the more challenging parts might require methods that have not been covered yet or only briefly touched on, so practice your Google-Fu and start looking things up!
