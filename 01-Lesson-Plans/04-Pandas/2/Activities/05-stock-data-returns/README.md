# Searching for a Stock Correlation

In this exercise, you'll be learning to merge and apply some analytics using Pandas. In the Data folder, there is a CSV with a year's worth of historical prices for a stock.

## This includes:
 - Reading a CSV file as a DataFrame.
 - Using built-in functions to merge and find correlation between two sets of data.
 - Creating calculated columns.
