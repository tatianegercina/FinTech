# CSV and Functions

With a clean and simple interface, this is a fun task for you to exercise your mind by reading a CSV file and running functions in your CSV loops.


## Instructions
You'll be creating a random number and searching the Phrase.csv file for a matching row ID.

Once a matching number is found, print out that row's information and the previous row's information using two different functions.

If nothing was found, print out a message stating it was not found and the row ID.
