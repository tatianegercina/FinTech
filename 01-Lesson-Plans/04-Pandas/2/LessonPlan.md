## 4.2 Lesson Plan: Pandas Review Day

### Overview

Today's class is an opportunity for students to review and practice fundamental programming skills in Pandas through a series of code drills.

### Instructor Notes

* Today's class will consist of Pandas code drills and review activities. Code drills are a simple way to build muscle memory and give students a chance to practice the fundamentals of programming in Pandas. Many of the code drills may seem trivial to some students, but the drills will help them become fluent in both syntax and basic problem solving.

* Code drills range in complexity and pace, so the time allotted to each section of activities should be fluid, to allow each student to work through the problems at their own pace. While it may be helpful to review certain drills or activities with the entire class, time will likely be best served by rotating between groups of students to address any issues that arise. This is also a good time to see how they are feeling about Pandas in general and to provide words of encouragement.

* You may be able to challenge students with code drill races where they pair off and race each other to complete a set of drills. Use this cautiously so that you don't overwhelm a beginning programmer.

* Overall, this should be a fun day for students, and it will help them build confidence with their programming skills. Be sure to offer a lot of support and encouragement to beginners.

### 1. Instructor Do: Welcome Students (5 min)

Welcome students and explain that today's class will be a fun Pandas review day. Every student will get the opportunity to work with the instructional staff to answer any Pandas questions they have, but the majority of time will be spent working through a series of Pandas code drills.

Explain code drills to students:

* For any activity (sports, music, painting, or programming), there is often a very steep learning curve when starting out. The good news is that research shows that focused daily practice helps facilitate rapid progression towards mastery of any skill. This is especially true for programming.

* The key to learning to code is simply to code. Building strong daily coding habits helps build muscle memory, which makes the process of typing code and remembering syntax easier.

* The goal is to practice coding in Pandas to the point where all the syntax of the language becomes second nature. This allows you to use your mental power on problem solving, and not on basic things, such as how to type a list or dictionary.

* Code drills are a way to help build that essential muscle memory. Designed to provide basic practice with coding, the problems range from simple to complex, and require focus on the fundamentals of the language.

Tell students that they will be given all of the code drills at once, and are free to work through them at their own pace. Meanwhile, the instructor and TAs will circulate to answer specific questions.

Encourage students to try and complete the simple code drills from memory as much as possible (googling answers as needed).

### 2. Student Do: Code Drills (175 min)

Students will be given the remaining class time to work through code drills at their own pace.

In addition to the code drills located in the repo, students can also work through the code drills located [here](https://github.com/guipsamora/pandas_exercises).
