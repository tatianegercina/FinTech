## 4.3 Lesson Plan: Whiteboard Interviews — Practice Makes Perfect!

### Overview

Today's workshop is an opportunity for students to review and practice technical interview guidelines in a peer-review setting.

### Class Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Verbalize and exercise methods for problem-solving strategies.
* Map out the guidelines on effectively articulating their problem-solving processes.
* Gain experience from practicing these strategies and guidelines.
* Reflect on their shortcomings and devise improvements to the solutions they develop.

### Instructor Notes

* Slack out the [Alpaca and Quandl Installation Guide](../Supplemental/AlpacaMarkets_Installation-Guide.md) and the [Postman Installation Guide](../Supplemental/PostmanInstallGuide.md). Tell students to complete the installation and verify it with a TA before the end of the next class. This should help catch installation issues outside of class time.

* Students should honestly evaluate their partners' performance as well as their own performance via the [grading rubric](Activities/02-Ins_Intro_to_Partner_Interviews/Solved/PeerTechnicalInterviewRubric.xlsx).

* Students should systematically apply the problem-solving guidelines with each problem; they can deviate once they've internalized the format, but *not* before.

* Since the only difference between workshops is the selection of interview questions, Instructors are provided a single Time Tracker and abbreviated Lesson Plan.

* Review the interview questions for the workshop ahead of time. These are available in the [Interview Questions](Activities/README.md) repository. You will need one question for each 30 minute interview — partners will *not* work on the same interview problems successively.

* Have your TAs refer to the `Workshop Time Tracker` to help keep track of time; more important than the Time Tracker is that students have adequate time to work through interview problems.

### 1. Instructor Do: Welcome Class (5 min)

Welcome students to the class and explain that they will be reviewing and practicing technical interview guidelines in a mock peer-review setting.

* Students will overview the problem-solving strategies and as well as the discussion guidelines and then run their own peer interviews for the rest of class.

* For the mock peer-review sessions, each student will have 25 minutes to work through a problem. Once the 25 minutes is up, students will switch. They will have 5 minutes to review feedback with each other before rotating pairs or interview questions.

* Emphasize that the purpose of these workshops is not primarily to find the correct answers to these questions. Rather, it is to train students to take the right *approach* to problem-solving. At this stage, following the guidelines matters more than finding the correct solution. This is because excellent communication is one of the most sought-after traits interviewers screen for.

### 2. Instructor Do: Introduce and Review Problem Solving Guidelines (15 min)

**Corresponding Activity:** [01-Ins_Problem_Solving_Guidelines](Activities/01-Ins_Problem_Solving_Guidelines)

In this activity, instructors will introduce the problem-solving guidelines that will help students to effectively outperform in a technical interview.

**Files:**

* [Problem Solving Guidelines](Activities/01-Ins_Problem_Solving_Guidelines/Solved/TechnicalInterviewGuidelines.pdf)



* Students will use the methodologies outlined in the [problem-solving guidelines](Activities/01-Ins_Problem_Solving_Guidelines/Solved/TechnicalInterviewGuidelines.pdf) to impress upon a technical interviewer that they are strong problem solvers. Specifically, students will use the following technical interview methodologies:

  * Restate and explain the problem with a concrete example.
  * Sketch the solution at a high level (for example, psuedocode).
  * Discuss the approach and any assumptions or shortcomings.
  * Translate and implement the solution into functional code.
  * Discuss the solution's shortcomings and corresponding potential improvements.

* More than anything, interviewers want to know an interviewee's mindset and ability to solve problems, even if he or she does not have the full answer or solution. Therefore, communication is absolutely key to outperforming in *any* interview, not just a technical interview.

* Additionally, it is important to interact and develop a relationship with the interviewer. Not only do interviewers want to know that an individual has the knowledge and capacity to perform a role, but also the personality that fits within the company's culture.

### 3. Instructor Do: Introduce Partner Interviews (15 min)

**Corresponding Activity:** [02-Ins_Intro_to_Partner_Interviews](Activities/02-Ins_Intro_to_Partner_Interviews)

In this activity, instructors will overview the process of the mock interviews for today's lesson.

**Files:**

* [Peer Interview Grading Rubric](Activities/02-Ins_Intro_to_Partner_Interviews/Solved/PeerTechnicalInterviewRubric.xlsx)


* Students will break off into pairs, with one student acting as the interviewer and the other student acting as the interviewee. Students will decide themselves who goes first in each role.

* Students will spend 30 minutes for each interview.

* After, the two interview sessions, there will be a 5 minute session to discuss feedback and potential areas of improvement.

* After each pair of students has gone through the full interview process (acted as both interviewer and interviewee and discussed feedback), students will break off into new pairs and repeat the process until the end of the class.

Then slack out the [peer interview grading rubric](Activities/02-Ins_Intro_to_Partner_Interviews/Solved/PeerTechnicalInterviewRubric.xlsx) and explain the following:

* The rubric will be used by interviewers to assess their corresponding partner's interview performances.

* The rubric includes a score of 0–3 for this criteria:

  * The interviewee adequately restated the problem.
  * The interviewee asked the interviewer for input and clarification.
  * The interviewee used a logical approach to solving the problem, regardless of a correct solution.

Ask the students if they have any questions before moving on.

### 4. Student Do: First Partner Interviews (30 min)

**Corresponding Activity:** [03-Stu_Partner_Interviews](Activities/03-Stu_Partner_Interviews)

In this activity, students will pair off with each other to perform mock interviews, with one student as the interviewer and the other as the interviewee.

**Files:**

* [README.md](Activities/03-Stu_Partner_Interviews/README.md)
* [Interview Questions](Activities/03-Stu_Partner_Interviews/Solved)

Slack out the [README.md](Activities/03-Stu_Partner_Interviews/README.md) and explain the following:

* Students should break off into their pairs. They can work with seatmates to start as they'll eventually rotate through the class. Student pairs should decide who will first play the role of the interviewer and who will first play the role of the interviewee.

* Students will have 5 minutes for the interviewer to review the interview question README and solution. The remaining 25 minutes will be allocated for the interview.

* Students should refer to the [problem solving guidelines](Activities/01-Ins_Problem_Solving_Guidelines/Solved/TechnicalInterviewGuidelines.pdf) to implement the methodologies into their interview performances.

Slack out the first [interview question](Activities/03-Stu_Partner_Interviews/Solved) and let the interviews begin!

---

### 5. Student Do: Second Partner Interviews (30 min)

**Corresponding Activity:** [03-Stu_Partner_Interviews](Activities/03-Stu_Partner_Interviews)

In this activity, students will switch roles in their mock interviews; the interviewer becomes the interviewee and vice versa.

* Similar to the timing of the first partner interviews, second partner interviews will retain 5 minutes for the (new) interviewer to review the interview question README and solution and then utilize the remaining 25 minutes for the actual interview.

* Again, students should refer to and implement the methodologies listed in the problem-solving guidelines document.

Slack out the next [interview question](Activities/03-Stu_Partner_Interviews/Solved) and let the second interviews begin!

---

### 6. Student Do: Trade Feedback (5 min)

In this activity, students will exchange interview feedback with their partners and discuss how they can improve their interview performances.

* After the second partner interviews are complete, students should exchange interview grading rubrics and discuss each other's performances.

* Feedback should mostly be positive in tone and should identify potential areas such as:

  * What their partners did best.

  * What their partners should focus on improving during their next interview.

* Students should deprioritize discussing the specific coding solutions at this stage; the important piece is not the answers, but how well students communicated their thought processes.

---

### 7. BREAK (15 min)

---

### 8. Student Do: Repeat (60 min)

In this activity, students break off into new pairs and repeat the procedures outlined in activities 4–6 for the remainder of the class.

* Instructors should allow 2 minutes for students to find new partners so that each individual works with a new classmate. This can be as simple as one partner shifting seats to the left, and one shifting seats to the right.

* Repeat the procedure outlined in activities 4 through 6 for the remainder of class.

* If the final interview round is expected to run past the end of class, instructors have two choices to account for timing constraints:

  1. Adjust the time allocations for the final round of interviews to fit within the remainder of class. For example, two 15-minute sessions for each student in their respective pairs.

  2. Perform a live demo of a sample interview problem with the class as a whole, allowing students to witness the technical interviewing skills of a veteran instructor.

---

### 9. Review and Reflect (5 min)

Instructors end the class with a review and discussion of students' technical interviews.

Facilitate student reflection by asking the students questions like:

* How did they feel during their mock interviews? Why did they feel that way?

* Did the problem-solving methodologies help their interviewing performances?

* What could they have done better in the future?

* Do they feel more confident now that they've had some technical interview practice?

Then, slack out the coding solutions for each interview question to the students for future reference.
