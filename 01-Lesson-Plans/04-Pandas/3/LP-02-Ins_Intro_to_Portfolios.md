### 2. Instructor Do: Intro to Portfolios (5 mins)

Engage the class with the following discussion around portfolios:

* What is an investment portfolio?

  > An investment portfolio is the grouping of various financial assets such as equity, bonds, commodities, private investments, etc, or just that of a single financial asset such as equity.

* What is a stock portfolio?

  > A stock portfolio is an investment portfolio consisting of only equity. Therefore a stock portflio consists of multiple stocks ranging from the 11 sectors of the equity market: financials, utilities, consumer discretionary, consumer staples, energy, healthcare, industrials, technology, telecom, materials, and real estate.

* Why are stock portfolios better than single stock investments?

  > Single stock investments are risky in that they represent the "all eggs in one basket dilemma". If the performance of a single stock fails, then so does the entirety of one's investment (as it is only tied to that particular stock). However, by grouping multiple stocks together, the risk is minimized or spread throughout the portfolio as a single stock may fail but others may continue to succeed.

* What is a stock market index?

  > Similar to a stock portfolio, a stock market index is a collection of stocks used to gauge the performance of a particular area within the stock market. For example, a popular stock market index is the S&P 500, a collection of 500 large market cap U.S. stocks which serve as a general health indicator of the overall U.S. stock market.

* Why do stock market indexes matter?

  > Stock market indexes, like the S&P 500, serve as general health indicators for particular areas in the stock market; however, they also serve as benchmarks to compare performances of portfolios. For example, how does the performance of one's personal stock portfolio compare to that of the S&P 500 or general stock market?
