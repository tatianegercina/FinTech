# Natural Language Processing Environment Installation Guide

This guide serves as a step by step process for setting up and validating the tools required for the natural language processing (NLP) portion of the curriculum. Without these tools, class activities and code cannot be completed.

This guide will include installation and verification steps for the following technologies:

## NLTK

The [Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)](https://www.nltk.org/) should already be installed through Anaconda. This unit requires additional downloads for NLTK using the following terminal command:

```shell
python -c "import nltk;nltk.download('all')"
```

## Wordcloud Library

In this unit, you will learn how to create word clouds visualizations to analyze text using [the `wordcloud` library](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/wordcloud).

To install this library, open the terminal and execute the following command:

```shell
conda install -c conda-forge wordcloud
```

### Verify the Worldcloud Library Installation

Once the `wordcloud` library download is complete, verify the installation completed successfully.

* Open the terminal and use the `conda list package_name` command, substituting `package_name` with `wordcloud` to verify the library installed successfully.

```shell
conda list wordcloud
```

## News API Python Client Library

In this unit, you will learn how to analyze text and sentiment from news articles using the [New API service](https://newsapi.org/). In order to interact with this service, you should install the [News API Python client library](https://newsapi.org/docs/client-libraries/python) as follows.

Open the terminal and execute the following command.

```shell
pip install newsapi-python==0.2.5
```

### Verify the News API Python Client Installation

Once the `newsapi-python` library download is complete, verify the installation completed successfully.

* Open the terminal and use the `conda list package_name` command, substituting `package_name` with `newsapi-python` to verify the library installed successfully.

```shell
conda list newsapi-python
```

## IBM Watson Python Library

In this unit, you will learn how to the [IBM Watson Tone Analyzer](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/tone-analyzer/) to analyze tone on text communications. In order to use this service, you need to install the [IBM Watson Python Library](https://pypi.org/project/ibm-watson/) as follows.

Open the terminal and execute the following command.

```shell
pip install --upgrade "ibm-watson>=3.0.3"
```

### Verify the IBM Watson Python Library Installation

Once the `ibm-watson` library download is complete, verify the installation completed successfully.

* Open the terminal and use the `conda list package_name` command, substituting `package_name` with `ibm-watson` to verify the library installed successfully.

```shell
conda list ibm-watson
```

## SpaCy Library Installation

In this unit, you will learn how to perform text analysis using [the `spacy` library](https://spacy.io/).

To install this library, open the terminal and execute the following commands:

```shell
conda install -c conda-forge spacy
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

The first command will install the `spacy` library; the second command is going to install the English language linguistic model that is going to be used in the activities.

### Verify the SpaCy Library Installation

Once the `spacy` library download is complete, verify the installation completed successfully.

* Open the terminal and use the `conda list package_name` command, substituting `package_name` with `spacy` to verify the library installed successfully.

```shell
conda list spacy
```

## `alpaca-trade-api` SDK Installation

In this unit you will use the Alpaca SKD you installed in the Financial APIs unit. If you are creating a new virtual environment for this unit, please reinstall the `alpaca-trade-api` SDK.

You can install this library running the following command in your terminal:

```shell
pip install alpaca-trade-api
```

### Verify the `alpaca-trade-api` SDK Installation

Once the `alpaca-trade-api` library download is complete, verify the installation completed successfully.

* Open the terminal and use the `conda-list` function with a `grep` argument to identify if the `alpaca-trade-api` library installed successfully.

```shell
conda list | grep alpaca-trade-api
```

## `python-dotenv` Library Installation

The `python-dotenv` library allows you to read key-value pairs from a `.env` file and adds them as environment variables.

You can install this library running the following command in your terminal:

```shell
pip install python-dotenv
```

### Verify the `python-dotenv` Library Installation

Once the `python-dotenv` library download is complete, verify the installation completed successfully.

* Open the terminal and use the `conda-list` function with a `grep` argument to identify if the `python-dotenv` library installed successfully.

```shell
conda list | grep python-dotenv
```

## Troubleshooting

It can be frustrating when packages do not install correctly. Use the below approaches to troubleshoot installation issues and get your machine learning libraries up and running!

### Update Conda Environment

An out-of-date Anaconda environment can create issues when trying to install new packages. Follow the below steps to update your conda environment.

1. Deactivate your current conda environment. This is required in order to update the global conda environment. Be sure to quit any running applications, such as Jupyter, prior to deactivating the environment.

    ```shell
    conda deactivate
    ```

2. Update conda.

    ```shell
    conda update conda
    ```

3. Create a fresh conda environment to use with PyViz.

    ```shell
    conda create -n mlenv python=3.7 anaconda
    ```

4. Activate the new environment.

    ```shell
    conda activate mlenv
    ```

5. Install all the required packages as it's described above.

### Anaconda is not Running!

If you have issues running or updating anaconda, you can check if the package is correctly installed by running the following command in your terminal.

```shell
conda list anaconda
```

After running this command, you should see a list with the anaconda packages installed in your environment, at least the packages in the red square should be listed.

![Anaconda List](Images/anaconda-env-list.png)

In case you guess your anaconda environment is broken, deactivate your current virtual environment and create a new one as it was described above.

### NewsAPI-Python

In the case where newsapi was installed instead of newsapi-python or newsapi was installed on top of newsapi-python. The recommended fix is to uninstall `newsapi-python` and `newsapi` and then proceed to reinstall `newsapi-python` ***only***.

`newsapi-python` and `newsapi` cannot coexist and strip essential needed classes from the client.

### Checking the Current Version of a Package

To validate which version of a package is installed in your environment, run the following command in the terminal, just as you did after each package installation in the above instructions.

```shell
conda list <package_name>
```

Where `<package_name>` is the name of the package you want to verify. For example, to corroborate the current version of the `spacy` package, you should run the following command in the terminal.

```shell
conda list spacy
```

This is the output you should see on the terminal window.

### Package is not Installed in Windows

Sometimes you can get the following message when you install a package using `conda install`

```shell
EnvironmentNotWritableError: The current user does not have write permissions to the target environment.
 environment location: C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3
```

If you ever see this message, try running the Git Bash terminal as `Administrator`. In Windows 10, you can do it as follows.

1. Right-click on the Git Bash icon.

2. Go over the `More` option.

3. Chose the `Run as administrator` option.
