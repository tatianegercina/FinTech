<summary>In a nutshell:</summary>

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the development of technology that works with translating human language components into something a computer can work with.   NLP is at work anytime you interact with technology that responds to your language inputs.  It can be thought of processing human language into computer inputs.

Examples include:
- Spell Checker
- Talk to Alexa, Siri or Googl Assistant.
- Voice to text on mobile devices

<summary>But why?</summary>

Computer speak is very specific; its unambigous, literal, methodical and mathematical.  Human language is quite the opposite - Words can share multiple meanings when used in different contexts, despite being spelled the same or sounding the same.  When translating words between languages, direct word for word translation will often sound nonsensical because the order of the words and cultural sayings vary.  Even different dialects of the same language can have words or sayings that mean different things depending on your geography.
