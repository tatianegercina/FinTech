# Counter

In this activity, you will create a function that preprocesses and outputs a list of the most common words in a corpus.

## Instructions

* Create a function called `word_counter` that takes in a list of documents and outputs a DataFrame that contains the 10 most frequent (preprocessed) words in the list of documents.
* Create a similar function called `bigram_counter` that outputs the 10 most frequent bigrams in the list of documents.
* Run both functions on the corpus of Reuters articles that has been prepared.

## Hint

* Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary where the keys are not column names can be tricky. One way of doing so involves using the `items()` function of the dictionary. Use Google to your advantage if you're having trouble implementing this part!
