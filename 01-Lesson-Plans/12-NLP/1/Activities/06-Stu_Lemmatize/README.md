# Lemmatize

In this activity, you will create a function that performs stopwording, regex cleaning of non-letter characters, word tokenizing, and lemmatization on each word in the article.

## Instructions

1. Complete a function called process_text that takes in a document and returns a list of words that is lemmatized, stopworded, tokenized, and free of any non-letter characters. 
2. When you're done, try different pos arguments for the lemmatization portion and examine the results. Which results seem more informative?
