# Crude Stopwords

In this activity, you will practice creating a function that strips non-letter characters from a document and then applies stopwording.

## Instructions

1. Complete a function called clean_text that takes in a document and returns a list of words that does not include stopwords or any non-letter characters. 
2. Inspect the results of this function, keeping track of the words that are uninformative. 
3. Reimplement clean_test, this time with a set of custom stopwords to apply.
