# Test Bitcoins

In this activity, you will extract a Bitcoin testnet address from your mnemonic, and if you do not have test bitcoins,
send the address to your instructor.

## Instructions

* Download a local copy of the BIP39 online converter from [the releases page](https://github.com/iancoleman/bip39/releases).

  * You will need to download the `bip30-standalone.html` file.

* Open this file in your browser.

* Paste the mnemonic you've been using in the `BIP39 Mnemonic` field.

* Select `BTC Testnet` in the `Coin` type dropdown:

* Scroll down and copy the first testnet address generated in the `Derived Address` field.

* Send this address to your instructor if you have not acquired test bitcoins yet.

* **Keep the first address and private key handy for copying later when we work with it in Python.**
