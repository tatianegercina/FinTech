### 6. Instructor Do: Importing Keys with Environment Variables Review (5 min)

Ask the students a few questions about why we wrote the code the way we did.

* What is the point of environment variables?

  **Answer**: One reason is for having machine-specific variables, another is to keep sensitive data out of the code.

* Why not just keep the key in the code?

  **Answer**: Anyone who has access to the code can then spend the funds.

* What else might environment variables be used for?

  **Answer**: Helping setup deployment environments, developer environments, etc.
