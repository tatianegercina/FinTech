# Acquiring Test Bitcoins

In this activity, you will extract a Bitcoin testnet address from your mnemonic, then request testnet coins to that address.

## Instructions

* Download a local copy of the BIP39 online converter from [the releases page](https://github.com/iancoleman/bip39/releases).

  * You will need to download the `bip39-standalone.html` file.

* Open this file in your browser.

* Paste the mnemonic you've been using in the `BIP39 Mnemonic` field.

* Select `BTC Testnet` in the `Coin` type dropdown:

* Navigate to one of the following Bitcoin Testnet faucets to request tokens:

  * https://bitcoinfaucet.uo1.net/

  * https://kuttler.eu/en/bitcoin/btc/faucet/

  * https://testnet-faucet.mempool.co/

  * https://testnet.help/en/btcfaucet/testnet

  * **Note:** If these faucets are empty or not available, you may need to perform a search for a `bitcoin testnet3 faucet`.

* Paste your testnet address, and click `Get bitcoins!`

## Hints

* In case you were wondering what this tool is doing, we will be learning all of the different wallet standards that this tool visualizes.

* For now, we only need this tool to get a Bitcoin test address from our beloved mnemonic phrase.
  We will learn how to do this ourselves, building a universal crypto wallet by the end of the week!
