* Remember when websites looked like this?

* This was the first generation of the web. The screenshot here is from February 2000.

* Now with Web 3.0, we refer less to the user experience, but to the infrastructure of the internet.

* In the current model, servers are highly centralized, websites can go down,
  and archiving information is a difficult task. For example, we all know how hard Wikipedia works to get you to donate.

* With the emergence of blockchains and other distributed technologies, we can build
  the Web 3.0 -- a decentralized web where sites like Wikipedia wouldn't struggle since we'd just store a local copy ourselves.

* Web3.py is a library gives us the ability to talk to Ethereum nodes in our favorite language, Python.

* Think of it like any other SDK you've used to talk to other APIs, only the API comes from an Ethereum node this time.

* Speaking of Ethereum nodes, let's get our networks started so we can start using this library.
