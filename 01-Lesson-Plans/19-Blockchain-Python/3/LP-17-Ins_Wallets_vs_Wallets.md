### 17. Instructor Do: Wallets vs Wallets (15 min)

In this activity you will return to the slideshow for visual assistance.

Now it's time to explain to the students some critical differences in the security models of different wallets.

Ask the students:

* Have any of you ever heard the term "hardware wallet" before?

* Have any of you heard the term "hot" or "cold" wallets before?

* Let's clarify a bit on what these mean.

Continue through the slideshow until:

* This is a hardware wallet. It looks like a USB drive right? Instead of storing files, what this device does is store your private keys. It can also sign transactions with those keys.

* Does anyone know why this is more secure than using our mnemonics like we have been?

  **Answer:** The hardware wallet never outputs the private keys once they are generated the first time.

* Essentially what this means is that this device will give you one, and only one opportunity to write down your mnemonic phrase.
  After that, the device will never output the private keys again. You can only use it to restore or generate a mnemonic.

* You are effectively asking the device to sign a transaction that you send to it over USB.
  Then, using the physical buttons on the device, you enter a PIN and confirm the details.

* Even if you lose the device, or it is stolen, your private keys are safe. If you get the PIN wrong too many times, it'll erase itself.
  Only the person that knows the PIN can spend the funds, and they won't be able to get the device to print out the keys either.

Now ask the students:

* If hardware wallets are so secure, why would we ever use anything else?

  **Answer:** Security is a spectrum.

Elaborate that a software wallet on your phone or laptop is like carrying physical cash with you, you only want to carry so much.

* It's really easy to pull cash out of your wallet, but it also carries some risk.

* A hardware wallet is more like a sealed bank vault, or an ATM.
  You're protected by a lot more security measures, but it's not always as convenient.
  Imagine being in line at the store, pulling out a hardware wallet, plugging it into your phone, opening the companion app,
  confirming the transaction details, then entering your PIN on the hardware wallet.
  That would take forever, and probably be a bit embarrasing!
  In this case, storing a bit of crypto in a software wallet app on your phone is much easier, and you can refill it when convenient.

Ask the students:

* Can anyone guess as to why software wallets aren't as secure as a hardware wallet?

  **Answer:** Computers and phones get hacked all the time!

Explain to the class:

* Since software wallets have to store the private keys in the devices memory, or RAM, there is a potential for malicious programs
  to steal it. If your operating system is compromised, so is all of the data it stores, including your private keys.

So what's this talk about "hot" vs "cold" wallets?

* When we refer to hot vs cold, we are referring to generally how often the wallet is accessed.

* "Hot" wallets tend to be live and ready to spend funds, and much easier to access.

* "Cold" wallets tend to store larger funds and are accessed less frequently, more like a vault.

Ask the students:

* So what would a "hot" wallet be in this case? Software or hardware?

  **Answer:** Software wallets are hot wallets.

* What would be a "cold" wallet?

  **Answer:** Hardware wallets.

Congratulations! Now you understand the different wallet standards, the different implementations of these wallets in hardware
and software, and when to use each!
