# If I were an exchange...

In this activity, you will get together into groups of 3-5 and design the architecture for an off-chain, centralized cryptocurrency exchange.

You will leverage the different wallet standards, as well as any other tools you have picked up along the way.

## Instructions

First, brainstorm with your group about the following bits of the architecture:

* Where would you store the funds that belong to the exchange?

* What type of wallet(s) would you use to manage the crypto keys?

* How would you correlate keys to each customer? What data would you need to keep track of a customer?

* How would you authorize the exchange spending money?

* How would you support multiple cryptocurrencies?

* How would you manage bidding and trading between users? How would you match two trades together?
 What would the transaction lifecycle of the trade look like, with you (the exchange) being the middle-man?

Once your group has decided on the general architecture of the exchange, write down the answers to these questions.
Then, summarize the architecture as if you were explaining it to an engineer; you needed to help build it.
