# Converting Mnemonics to Keys

In this activity, you will download a local copy of the BIP39 online conversion tool
and use it to derive your master seed/key from your English word mnemonic you've been
using throughout the blockchain section of the course.

## Instructions

* Navigate to the `Releases` Github page for the [BIP39 tool](https://github.com/iancoleman/bip39/releases)
 and download the latest version of `bip39-standalone.html` from the assets dropdown.

* Open the downloaded `bip39-standalone.html` in your favorite browser.

* Paste your mnemonic phrase into the `BIP39 Mnemonic` textbox.

* Observe the `BIP39 Seed` area. This should contain a random string of numbers and letters. If so, success!
