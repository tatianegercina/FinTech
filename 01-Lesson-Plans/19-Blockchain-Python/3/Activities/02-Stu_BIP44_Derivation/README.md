# Multi-Coin Wallets with BIP44

In this activity, you will generate keys for multiple blockchains using the BIP44 standard.

## Instructions

* Navigate to the top of the BIP39 tool.

* Change the coin type from `Bitcoin` to `Bitcoin Testnet`.

* Scroll down to the keys. Confirm that these are the same as used in the Bit activities by checking them on a block explorer.

* Change the coin type to `Ethereum`.

* Confirm that the keys are the same as used throughout the class by checking them on an ETH block explorer.

* Navigate to the [SLIP44](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md) "Registered Coin Types" list.

* Take a look at all of the different coins available.
