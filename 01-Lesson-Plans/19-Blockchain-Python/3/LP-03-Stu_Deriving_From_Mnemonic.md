### 3. Students Do: Converting Mnemonic to Seed (10 min)

In this activity, students will download a local copy of the BIP39 online tool
and paste their mnemonics into it to convert to a master seed.

**Instructions:**

* [README.md](Activities/03-Stu_Converting_Mnemonic.md/README.md)

Have TAs circulate and ensure that students are able to convert their mnemonics successfully by verifying the `BIP39 Seed`
segment is generated from the `BIP39 Mnemonic` segment.

### 4. Instructor Do: Review BIP39 (5 min)

Ask the students the following questions:

* Why is BIP39 important?

  **Answer:** It allows people to remember and write down a much more human-friendly version of the key.

* What sort of mistakes do human readable keys prevent?

  **Answer:** Incorrectly writing down the private key string.

* Why did we download the offline version of the BIP39 tool?

  **Answer:** It is more secure, since the online version can still get hacked.
  It is safer to download the open source code straight from Github and run it locally.
