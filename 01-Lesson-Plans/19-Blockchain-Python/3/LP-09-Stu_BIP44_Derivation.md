### 9. Students Do: Deriving Multiple Coins with BIP44 (10 min)

Now it's time for the students to derive multiple coins from their mnemonics.

**Instructions:**

* [README.md](Activities/09-Stu_BIP44_Derivation/README.md)

Have the TAs circulate and ensure that students are generating BTC testnet and Ethereum keys, and that they match those that they used previously in the course.

### 10. Instructor Do: Review BIP44 (5 min)

Ask the students:

* Why is BIP44 useful?

  **Answer:** It allows you to use one master key across multiple blockchains!

  **Answer:** It still supports multiple addresses like BIP32.

  **Answer:** It allows the rest of the crypto and blockchain community to be more interoperable.

* Would an exchange or an innovative bank use BIP44? Why?

  **Answer:** Yes, it would use it to keep track of customer's keys across multiple blockchains.

* Where does the list of coin types come from?

  **Answer:** BIP44's sister standard, SLIP44.

Congratulate the students on learning about the wallet standards that the entire crypto community has settled upon using!

Explain that they can now take this understanding anywhere in the blockchain space, and
that all blockchains have an incentive to integrate with this universal standard.

### 12. Instructor Do: Welcome Back to Class (5 min)

Welcome the students back to class and ask a few recall questions:

* What is BIP39?

  **Answer:** The standard that allows us to convert mnemonics to master keys.

* What is BIP32?

  **Answer:** The standard that allows us to generate a tree of keys from the master seed.

* What is BIP44?

  **Answer:** The standard that allows us to generate trees of keys for multiple coins, all from the original master seed!
