### 18. Students Do: "If I Were an Exchange" Thought Experiment (15 min)

In this activity, students will break into small groups and design an exchange given the different wallet standards
and software/hardware implementations.

**Instructions:**

* [README.md](Activities/18-Stu_If_I_Were_Exchange/README.md)

Have TAs circulate and ask questions about the students exchange designs, including what type of wallets they'd use
and how they manage the funds.

### 19. Instructor Do: Exchange Design Review (10 min)

While each group of students may have slightly different designs, generally the centralize exchanges use similar implementations.

Have the students present their designs, picking a group leader to describe the architecture to the class.

Ask the students the following questions:

* What type of wallet would be the best for an exchange to use?

  **Answer:** Hardware wallet

* Should you keep all of the funds available to spend or should you keep a percentage offline?

  **Answer:** You should store most of the funds offline, then when customers withdraw, do the withdraws in bulk.

* How might a decentralized exchange work differently?

  **Answer:** The exchange wouldn't need to hold any keys or funds, but would purely facilitate direct peer to peer trades.

* What is the advantage to a centralized exchange?

  **Answer:** Easy onboarding, you can hold the company liable.

  **Answer:** Potentially higher liquidity, and leverage options. More advanced services may be provided.

* What are some disadvantages to centralized exchanges?

  **Answer:** If the exchange gets hacked, the crypto is gone for good. This can sink the exchange.

  **Answer:** Customers don't own or manage the private keys being used, which means the exchange has control over the funds.

* What wallet standards have we learned?

  **Answer:** BIP39, BIP32, and BIP44

### 20. Instructor Do: Recap (35 min)

This section is reserved for career services.
Otherwise, recall questions about the previous activities, or have the students design a decentralized exchange.
