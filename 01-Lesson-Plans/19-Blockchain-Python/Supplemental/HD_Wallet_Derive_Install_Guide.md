# HD Derive Wallet Install Guide

This guide serves as a step by step process for setting up the `hd-wallet-derive` library used to derive BIP32 addresses and private keys for Bitcoin and other alternative coins or "altcoins".

## Environment Setup

The `hd-wallet-derive` library is written in the PHP language, therefore students will be required to first set up PHP on their machines before installing and then running the `hd-wallet-derive` library.

**Note:** For the Windows installation we will be using the XAMPP package while for the Mac OS X installations we will be using Homebrew. The reasoning for this is because the XAMPP installation on MAC OS X does not provide a clearly defined path to the PHP installation, which is necessary for using the PHP CLI.

For those with a **Windows operating system**, execute the following steps:

* Windows machines do not come with a pre-built PHP and Apache Web Server, and therefore will require both. Luckily, there are installers that bundle these two together! Visit the [XAMPP website](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) and download the installer for Windows; the XAMPP is a popular PHP development environment that is easy to install and configure.

* Use the XAMPP package to install PHP and its associated dependencies. Keep the defaults for now unless there is a dependency conflict.

* Then, once the XAMPP package is installed, navigate to the folder where the PHP binaries are installed. This should be at `C:\xampp\php`.

*  Edit the `php.ini` file (`C:\xampp\php\php.ini`) and add the following line to the file:

```shell
extension=php_gmp.dll
```

* This will enable a necessary PHP extension that `hd-wallet-derive` relies on.

* Next, navigate to the System Environment Variables and edit the `Path` environment variable; add the path containing the PHP binaries to the end of the `Path` environment variable.

* Lastly, test that the newest version of PHP is working by first creating a test PHP script called `phpinfo.php` and then executing the following command.

  ```php
  <?php

  // Show all information, defaults to INFO_ALL
  phpinfo();

  ?>
  ```

  ```shell
  php -S localhost:8000 phpinfo.php
  ```

* The terminal should output the following and spin up a web server to showcase the results of the test `phpinfo` script. If you see the following output, then congratulations! Your machine is now updated to the newest version of PHP!

For those with a **Mac OS X operating system**, execute the following steps:

* Mac OS X already comes pre-built with PHP and the Apache Web Server; however, we will need to upgrade the PHP version to 7.3. Therefore, to do so make sure that Homebrew, a package manager for Mac OS, is installed on your Mac OS machine. If not, visit the [Homebrew website](https://brew.sh/) and install Homebrew using the given install command.

* Once Homebrew is installed, execute the following command in your terminal. This should install the latest version of PHP (7.3 at this current time).

  ```shell
  brew install php@7.3
  ```

* Then, in order to point to the newest version of PHP, export the following path to your `PATH` environment variable. This will allow you to run the command `php` from anywhere in your terminal and point to the Homebrew version that was just installed.

  ```shell
  export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin
  ```

* Next, test that the newest version of PHP is working correctly by first creating a test PHP script called `phpinfo.php` and then executing the following command.

  ```php
  <?php

  // Show all information, defaults to INFO_ALL
  phpinfo();

  ?>
  ```

  ```shell
  php -S localhost:8000 phpinfo.php
  ```

* The terminal should output the following and spin up a web server to showcase the results of the test `phpinfo` script. If you see the following output, then congratulations! Your machine is now updated to the newest version of PHP!

## Installation

Now that the latest version of PHP is installed on our machines, we can now proceed to the installation of the `hd-wallet-derive` library.

Execute the following steps:

* Navigate to the [Github website](https://github.com/dan-da/hd-wallet-derive) for the `hd-wallet-derive` library and scroll down to the installation instructions.

  ![hd-wallet-derive-github](Images/hd-wallet-derive-github.png)

* Next, open a terminal and execute the following commands. If you are using Windows, you will need to open the Git-Bash GUI via `C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash` directly to enable something called `tty` mode that makes the terminal more compatible with Unix systems. Once installed, you may move back to using the usual Git-Bash terminal.

  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/dan-da/hd-wallet-derive
  cd hd-wallet-derive
  php -r "readfile('https://getcomposer.org/installer');" | php
  php composer.phar install
  ```

* You should now have a folder called `hd-wallet-derive` containing the PHP library.

## Execution

Last step! Execute the `hd-wallet-derive` library to derive derive BIP32 addresses and private keys for Bitcoin and other alternative coins.

* Navigate to your `hd-wallet-derive` folder.

  ![hd-wallet-derive-folder](Images/hd-wallet-derive-folder.png)

* Then execute the following commands (these are examples from the GitHub website).

  ```shell
  ./hd-wallet-derive.php -g --key=xprv9tyUQV64JT5qs3RSTJkXCWKMyUgoQp7F3hA1xzG6ZGu6u6Q9VMNjGr67Lctvy5P8oyaYAL9CAWrUE9i6GoNMKUga5biW6Hx4tws2six3b9c
  ```

  ```shell
  ./hd-wallet-derive.php -g --key=xprv9tyUQV64JT5qs3RSTJkXCWKMyUgoQp7F3hA1xzG6ZGu6u6Q9VMNjGr67Lctvy5P8oyaYAL9CAWrUE9i6GoNMKUga5biW6Hx4tws2six3b9c --numderive=3 --preset=bitcoincore --cols=path,address --path-change
  ```

* Congratulations! The `hd-wallet-derive` library should now be working and good to go!
