# Blockchain Transactions Terminology Guide

This guide serves as an overview for the various concepts required to understand the notion of sending and receiving transactions over a blockchain network using virtual wallets.

## Terminologies

* What is encryption?

  **Answer:** Encryption is the process in which a message is encoded in a format that cannot be read or understood by an external party lacking the necessary credentials.

* What is symmetric encryption?

  **Answer:** Symmetric encryption is the simplest type of encryption that uses only a single key (a private/secret key) to both encrypt and decrypt information. As a result, the parties communicating via symmetric encryption must exchange the secret key so that it can be used in the decryption process, which is a security disadvantage compared to asymmetric encryption.

* What is an asymmetric key?

  **Answer:** Asymmetric encryption uses a key pair: a public and private key. As the name suggests, the public key is made freely available to anyone on the Internet while the private key is kept a secret by the end-user. Therefore, messages that are encrypted using the public key can only be decrypted using the associated private key, and messages that are encrypted using the private key can only be decrypted using the associated public key.

* What are the advantages vs. disadvantages of both types of encryption techniques?

  **Answer:** Symmetric encryption is the oldest and best-known technique for encryption; however, because of its use of only a single key (the private/secret key), there is the potential for a breach in security when exchanging the private key between two parties, especially over a vast network such as the Internet with possible eavesdroppers. In contrast, due to the use of a key pair in asymmetric encryption (public and private key), the private key is never exchanged and therefore is kept a secret at all times. Though as a result of the use of a key pair, asymmetic encryption is slower than symmetric encryption due to the increased processing power used to encrypt and decrypt messages.

* What is a digital signature?

* What is a wallet?

* What is a hash?

* What is BIP?

* What is BIP32?

* What is BIP39?

* What is BIP44?
