# Deep Learning on the Web

In this activity, you will use the text classification demo notebook to understand and modify a deep learning classification model with Google Colab.

## Instructions

* Work with a partner for this activity.

* Read through the [_Text classification with movie reviews_ notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/tutorials/keras/text_classification.ipynb) completely.

* Take turns explaining what each code block is doing; make sure that you both agree.

* In the _Build the model_ section, experiment with the neural network architecture defined to increase the accuracy of the model and decrease loss to the maximum extent possible.
