# Deep Learning on the Web

In this activity students will use the text classification demo notebook to understand and modify a deep learning classification model with Colab. 

## Instructions

* Work with a person next to you for this activity. 

* Read through the [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/docs/blob/r2.0rc/site/en/r2/tutorials/keras/basic_text_classification.ipynb) completely. Take turns explaining to each other what each code block is doing and make sure that you both concur. 

* Experiment with the neural net architecture used to increase the accuracy of the model and decrease loss to the maximum extent possible.
