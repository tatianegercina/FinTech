# Sound of Music

In this activity students will build a model to predict the geographical origins of a musical composition. 

## Instructions

* Create a shallow (1 hidden layer) and deep neural net to predict the geographical coordinates of the compositions represented in the data. 

* Compare the loss metrics for the two models. 

* Compare train and test metrics for both models, and look for signs of overfitting. 

## Hint

* Note that that there needs to be two regression outputs. Your model structure should reflect this.
