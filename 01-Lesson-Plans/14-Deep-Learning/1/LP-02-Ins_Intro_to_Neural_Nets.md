### 2. Instructor Do: Intro to Neural Networks (15 mins)

Use the "Introduction to Neural Networks" section of the slides to go over the following points:

* Artificial neural networks are a class of machine learning algorithms that can be used to for regression or classification tasks, just like other ML algorithms.

* Neural networks were inspired by the human brain, which consists of networks of biological neurons that communicate with each other with electrical signals. 

* Artificial neural networks (which we'll shorten to neural nets), similarly consist of neurons that are connected to other neurons and receive and send signals to other neurons. This arrangement of neurons allows neural nets to take inputs and learn complex patterns in the data to predict outcomes.

* The arrangement of neurons in a neural net, often called its architecture, is what allows these algorithms to learn non-linear, complex functions. Different architectures, in addition to other parameters and hyperparameter settings, will cause the neural net to behave in different ways suitable to different tasks. For example, we will learn about recurrent neural nets, which given their ability to "remember" past input, are often used to NLP and time series prediction tasks. 

* Neural nets are used in many, many applications, but a few important cases include image recognition, training word embeddings for natural language processing, and time series forecasting. They are especially powerful in tasks that involve a large number of features and large training sets. 

Explain to students that in this class, we will give an intuitive introduction to the components that make up a neural net and how they work together to learn. Ask students to provide examples of data sets or problems that they have already worked with in the course that may be suitable for neural nets, and why. Take any questions before moving on to the next section.
