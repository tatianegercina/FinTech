## Smarter Learning

In this activity, you will use TensorFlow Playground to create neural nets to optimize results for a classifcation and regression problem. 

### Instructions

1. Use [Tensorflow Playground](http://playground.tensorflow.org) to configure neural nets to minimize the loss metric for 1) the "swirl" classification problem and 2) the "multi-gaussian" distribution regression problem. 
2. You may change the input features, number of neurons in the hidden layer, activation functions, learning rate, and batch size. 
3. Note how well your neural net fits the data, and how efficiently it does so. Report which configurations seem to work best, and which hyperparameters seem to create the most changes in how the model behaves.
