## Playing with Neurons

In this activity, you will use TensorFlow Playground to create neural nets to classify the remaining two sets of data. 

### Instructions

1. Use [Tensorflow Playground](http://playground.tensorflow.org) to configure neural nets to classify the two data sets that we did not go over in the demo.
2. Change only the input features and the number of neurons in the hidden layer (not the number of layers).
3. Note how well your neural net fits the data, and how efficiently it does so. Report which configuration of input and hidden layer neurons had the best results.
