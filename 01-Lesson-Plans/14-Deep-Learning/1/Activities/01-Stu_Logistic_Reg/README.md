## Review Logistic Regression

In this activity, you will use the Pima Diabetes dataset to train a logistic regression classifier to predict diabetes.

### Instructions

1. Use the sklearn logistic regression implementation to predict the loan status of a test sample of the loans data. 
2. Output the probability that each loan will be appproved. 
3. Calculate the mean squared error for the **probabilities** the model outputs. 

### Hints

* The LogisticRegression module has a predict_proba function that outputs probabilities of predicted classes.
* The metrics module in scikit learn can help you calculate the mean squared error statistic.
