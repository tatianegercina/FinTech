## 14.1 Lesson Plan: Neural Networks

### Overview

Today's class introduces students to a neural networks, a new member of the machine learning algorithms that can be used for classification and regression problems, but are perhaps uniquely able to learn very complex, non-linear models. Conceptually, neural networks were inspired by neurons in the human brain, and have a similar property of scaling to meet the complex environments that they operate in.

Neural networks are very flexible in their applications, but they are not necessarily meant to be "plug-and-play." From preprocessing input data to constructing a neural network architecture, students will learn the process to successfully construct and use neural networks.

### Class Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Explain the concept of neural networks, including how a neuron is akin to logistic regression.

* Explain the intuition of how weights of neurons are determined.

* Understand how choice of inputs and hidden layers apply to problems regression and classification.

* Experiment with architecture in Tensor Flow playground.

* Preprocessing data for neural network models.

* Identify the Python libraries available to build neural networks.

* Describe what are the pros and cons of using Keras for building neural networks.

* Implement neural nets with Python Keras API.

### Instructor Notes

* This lesson is packed with a lot of technical complexities, so be mindful of pacing when progressing through the day. Give students the opportunity to ask questions, and when necessary, have students save questions for the review sessions.

* A thorough understanding of neural networks would require math that's beyond the scope of this class. Luckily, we only need an intuitive understanding of the underlying algorithms in order to implement a neural network. Some details will necessarily need to be glossed over, but we will provide some additional materials for those students who are inclined to dig deeper.

### 1. Instructor Do: Welcome Class (5 mins)

**Files:**

* [Welcome-slides]()

Welcome students to the first day of deep learning! Indicate that today (day 1) will begin with an introduction to the basic unit of neural networks before moving on to constructing simple neural nets. Today's activities will be concept-heavy, so students should be prepared to discuss and think, and not merely to practice steps for implementation. Today should also be fun, since we'll be playing with neural nets in several ways to experiment with input, architecture, and algorithms.

Ask if there are any questions before moving on.
