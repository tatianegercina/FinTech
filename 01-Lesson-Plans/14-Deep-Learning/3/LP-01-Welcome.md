## 14.3 Lesson Plan: Recurrent Neural Networks

---

### Overview

Today's class will introduce students to recurrent neural networks (RNN).

### Class Objectives

By the end of the unit, students will be able to:

* Identify the differences between ANN (artificial neural network), RNN, and LSTM (long short-term memory) RNN models.

* Prepare data to fit LSTM RNN models.

* Define RNN models for sentiment analysis.

* Create LSTM RNN models for time series forecasting.

* Evaluate LSTM RNN models to discriminate against the best architecture for a given problem.

### Instructor Notes

* Slack out the [Streamz Installation Guide](../../15-Algorithmic-Trading/Supplemental/Asyncio_Streamz_Install_Guide.md) and the [CCXT Installation Guide](../../15-Algorithmic-Trading/Supplemental/CCXT_Install_Guide.md). Tell students to complete the installation and verify it with a TA before the end of the next class. Students will need this installed before the next unit.

* Today's class is brief but may be challenging for students. Take extra time during the activities today to ensure that students can follow along.

* A few students may want to go even deeper into the theory and math behind RNNs, but it would be best to direct those in-depth discussions to office hours. Encourage students to review the reference links and to think about ways that they might be able to incorporate RNNs into their projects.

### Slideshow and Time Tracker

* The slides for this lesson can be viewed on Google Drive here: [Lesson Slides]().

* To add the slides to the student-facing repository, download the slides as a PDF by navigating to File, selecting "Download as," and then choosing "PDF document." Then, add the PDF file to your class repository along with other necessary files. You can view instructions for this [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XM90c4s9XjwZHjdUlwEMcv2iXcO_yRGx5p2iLZ3BGNI/edit?usp=sharing).

### 1. Instructor Do: Welcome Class (5 min)

Welcome students to the third day of deep learning!

Open the lesson slides, and briefly cover today's agenda and class objectives. Explain to students that they will learn about recurrent neural networks (RNN), a type of neural network that can remember the past and combine that knowledge with new inputs to make decisions.
