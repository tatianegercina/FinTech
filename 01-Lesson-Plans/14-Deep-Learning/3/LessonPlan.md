### 1. Instructor Do: Welcome Class (5 min)

Welcome students to the third day of deep learning! Today students will be introduced to recurrent neural networks (RNN), a type of neural nets that are able to remember the past and its decisions are influenced by what it has learnt from the past.

Open the lesson slides, move to the _Intro to Recurrent Neural Networks_ section and highlight the following:

* RNSs are good for sequential patterns recognition.

* Some examples include:

  * DNA sequences

  * Series of stock prices over time

  * Even music composition

Answer any questions before moving on.
