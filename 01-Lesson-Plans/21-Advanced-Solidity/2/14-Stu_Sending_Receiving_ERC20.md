### 14. Students Do: Sending and Receiving ERC20 tokens (15 min)

In this activity, students will pair up and exchange each other's tokens on the testnet. They will also explore the transactions and the contract on the Etherscan block explorer, which provides more detail for ERC20-compliant smart contracts.

**Instructions:**

* [README.md](Activities/14-Stu_Sending_Receiving_ERC20/README.md)

Have TAs circulate the room and ensure that students are able to call their contract functions properly, and mint and transfer tokens to each other.

### 15. Instructor Do: Recap (10 min)

Ask the students the following questions:

* What are some benefits of using standards when developing smart contracts?

  * **Answer:** We utilize the community driven implementations to prevent bugs and security holes.

  * **Answer:** It makes it easier for us to develop our applications.

* What does OpenZeppelin provide as a library?

  * **Answer:** Security tools.

  * **Answer:** Standardized implementations of official ERCs to make developer lives easier.

* What is the difference between fungible and non-fungible?

  * **Answer:** Fungible refers to tokens where you ask "how many," wheras non-fungible refer to tokens where you ask "which one."

  * **Answer:** Fungible tokens are like-kinds, where each token can be exchanged with another of the same value without making a difference. Non-fungible tokens are unique per-token, meaning each token has its own properties and value, like artwork or legal certificates.

* Why was MetaMask able to understand, send, and receive our ArcadeTokens?

  * **Answer:** MetaMask is compatible with the ERC20 standard, so it can recognize and utilize our tokens!
