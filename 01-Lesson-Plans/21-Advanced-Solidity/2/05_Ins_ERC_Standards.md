### 5. Instructor Do: ERC Standards (10 min)

In this activity, students will be introduced to various ERC standards. Students will gain the understanding that such specifications exist to standardize smart contract use cases to avoid bugs and security vulnerabilities.

* Ethereum is continuing to grow and rapidly evolve as the crypto community and the world continues to expand on the concepts of Web3 and blockchain.

* Throughout these periods of change, standards are formed to lead to best practices within the platform to prevent bugs and security vulnerabilities.

* Today we will be discussing several of these standards, also known as `EIP`s, we will specifically be talking about `ERC`s a type of `EIP` specifically related to application-level standards and conventions such as smart contracts.

* The ERCs we will be focusing on today are `20, 721, 777, 1155`.

  * EIP 20: ERC20 Fungible Token Standard

  * EIP 721: ERC721 Non-Fungible Token Standard

  * EIP 777: ERC777 Fungible Token Standard

  * EIP 1155: ERC1155 Multi-Token Standard

* The following categories of `EIP`s exist.

  * Core

  * Networking

  * Interface

  * ERC

  * Meta

  * Information

* The Ethereum foundation officially refers to `EIP`s as `A design document providing information to the Ethereum community, or describing a new feature for Ethereum or its processes or environment`.

Core EIPs follow a slightly different process from the rest of the EIP categories. Since ERCs are not in the `Core` EIP category, it will follow the process below, just like the rest:

[ WIP ] -> [ DRAFT ] -> [ LAST CALL ] -> [ FINAL ]

* The stages of the process consist of the following.

  * WIP - During the `work in progress` phase, EIP creators formulate their EIP and may ask the community forums for input.

  * Draft - During the draft phase, the initial draft and any changes are merged in as a pull request. The EIP must be implemented to progress to the next phase.

  * Last Call - During the last call phase, the EIP is listed on the [https://eips.ethereum.org/](https://eips.ethereum.org/) website under the Last call section. If there are no unaddressed technical complaints will or changes to source material required, then the changes will become Final.

  * Final -  The EIP becomes final, reflecting the most state-of-the-art standard.

* Up to this point, we have discussed the concept of tokens, have implemented our own basic token standard, and have learned that tokens can represent both fungible and non-fungible goods.

* There are ERC standards that the community has established to implement different use cases including `fungible` and `non-fungible` tokens. We have built our own `fungible` token using our own logic, but we should be able to find the latest community standards when we go to build our tokens and dApps in production.

* Assure students that by being able to follow the newest accepted `Ethereum Improvement Proposals`, that they will be able to stay up to date on the current Ethereum standards, practices, and technologies.
