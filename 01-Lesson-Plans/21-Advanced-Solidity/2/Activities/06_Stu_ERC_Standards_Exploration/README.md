# ERC Standards Exploration

In this activity, you will be exploring the various token standards.

## Instructions

* In your web browser navigate to the Ethereum foundation's [Online list of ERCs](https://eips.ethereum.org/erc)

* As you are reading through the various ERC standards, write down a few things that you find interesting about each one.

* Click the following ERC standards `21, 721, 77, 1155`, and read their abstract, motivation, and specification sections.

* Click two additional standards of your choice, and read their abstract, motivation, and specification sections.

## Challenge

## Hints

* Remember that only the ERC's under the `Final` section are officially accepted ERC's.
