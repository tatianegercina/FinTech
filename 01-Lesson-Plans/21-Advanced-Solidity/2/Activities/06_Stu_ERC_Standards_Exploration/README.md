## Instructions

* In your web browser navigate to the Ethereum foundation's [Online list of ERCs](https://eips.ethereum.org/erc)

* Click the following ERC standards `21, 721, 77, and 1155`, and read their abstract, motivation, and specification sections.

* As you are reading through the various ERC standards, write down a few things that you find interesting about the various aspects of the standards.

## Challenge
