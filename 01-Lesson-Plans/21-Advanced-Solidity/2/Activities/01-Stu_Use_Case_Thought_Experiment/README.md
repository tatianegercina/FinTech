# Use Case Thought Experiment

We have been discussing tokens, tokenomics, and tokens' ability to represent a store of value on the Ethereum blockchain. In the previous activity, we learned that there are two primary use cases for tokens in the form of `fungible` and `non-fungible` goods. In the following activity, you will pair with other students around you to brainstorm your potential use-cases for fungible and non-fungible tokens on the blockchain.

## Instructions

* Get into groups of 3 - 5 people.

* Each person should take notes.

* Discuss within your group potential use cases for fungible and non-fungible tokens.

* As you discuss with your group, maintain a list of potential use cases.

* Pick the most interesting use case from each fungible and non-fungible to share with the class.

## Challenge

* If time remains, with your group members, pick a token on your list that you all like and begin writing some of the smart contract rules for that token's system.

## Hints

* An example of a fungible token is a dental token that will allow you to pay to get dental healthcare in countries that do not support USD.

* An example of a `non-fungible` token would be tokenizing land on mars to help fundraise for martian land development.

* Remember that a token can be used to represent virtually any store of value.

* When brainstorming, consider the 5 Pillars of Open Blockchain: Open, Neutral, Borderless, Censor Resistant, and Public while developing your token concepts.
