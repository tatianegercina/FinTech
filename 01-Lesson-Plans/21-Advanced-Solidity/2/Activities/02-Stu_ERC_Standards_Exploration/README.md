# ERC Standards Exploration

In this activity, you will be exploring the various token standards.

## Instructions

* In your web browser navigate to the Ethereum foundation's [Online list of ERCs](https://eips.ethereum.org/erc)

* As you are reading through the various ERC standards, write down a few things that you find interesting about each one. Make a note of whether each standard is `fungible` or `non-fungible`.

* For each standard read the `Abstract` and `Motivation` sections.

* Explore the following ERC standards:

  * ERC 20

  * ERC 721

  * ERC 777

  * ERC 1155

## Challenge

* If time remains, try brainstorming what ERC standards you would want to see in the list.

## Hints

* Remember that only the ERC's under the `Final` section are officially accepted ERC's.
