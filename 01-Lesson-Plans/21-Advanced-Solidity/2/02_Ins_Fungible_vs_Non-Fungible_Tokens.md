### 2. Instructor Do: Fungible vs Non-Fungible Tokens (10 min)

In this activity, students will be introduced to the concepts of fungible vs non-fungible tokens and their differences.

You will be starting with real-world examples and move into digital examples. Refer to the following link for additional documentation [OpenZeppenlin Documentation: Tokens](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/tokens#_different_kinds_of_tokens)

* As previously discussed, tokens can be used to represent any potential store of value including, votes, currency, and property.

* Tokens and the idea of tokenomics is an extremely powerful concept, but it goes a lot deeper than just representing the value of an asset.

Have the class consider the following question?

* What happens if two assets are not of the same value, how do you represent them both with tokens?

Expand on the previous question with the following points and introduce the concept of `fungibility`.

* Se we have things of equal value that are interchangeable with one another, and we have things that are not of equal value that are therefore not interchangeable with one another. This concept is refereed to as `fungibility`.

* Examples of fungible goods include cryptocurrencies, fiat currencies, and voting rights.

  * A vote is a vote, if you have two people that both have votes, then their votes both have the same voting power. Just like if you have two people that both have a `nickel`; both nickels are worth the same 5 cents.

* Examples of non-fungible goods include pieces of land, diamonds, or collectibles.

  * A person could own a piece of land in San Diego, and a piece of land in Pennsylvania, these two pieces of land are different, they do not hold the same value and are therefore not interchangeable with one another. The same could be said for two different collectible figures like a Pop Vinyl or a Beanie Baby; each collectible is unique.

* Previously, we implemented our own basic token standard. Today we will be discussing and using some of the community accepted standards for implementing both fungible and non-fungible tokens.

Now that the students have a basic understanding of `fungibility`, discuss some of the real-world implementations of `fungible` and `non-fungible` tokens on the blockchain.

In your web browser open the [CryptoKitties Website](https://www.cryptokitties.co/)

* `CryptoKitties` is a popular `non-fungible` token on the Ethereum blockchain.

* `CryptoKitties` is also a dApp that allows users to buy and sell, and breed virtual cats.

* At the crypto peak in 2017 some `crypto kitties` were valued at over 130 thousand US dollars.

Remind the students that we have already discussed many examples of `fungible` tokens yesterday. Examples include:

* Basic Attention Token (BAT)

* Golem (GNT)

* Maker Dao (Dai)

* Our Arcade Token (ARCD)
