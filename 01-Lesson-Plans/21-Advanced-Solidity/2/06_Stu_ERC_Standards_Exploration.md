### 06. Students Do: ERC Standards Exploration (15 min)

In this activity, students will be exploring the various ERC standards that are currently being developed, and that have been accepted as final.

Send out the instructions and have TAs circulate the class.
**Instructions:**

* [README.md](Activities/06_Stu_ERC_Standards_Exploration/README.md)

Explain to the students:

* You will be exploring the ERC standards that are currently being developed or have been finalized by the community.

* As you explore the standards, when you see something interesting, relevant, or a keyword that sticks out, click on the standard and read the `Motivation` and `Abstract` sections. If the ERC goes over your head, that's okay. Try to get a basic understanding of the motivation, don't worry about the technical specifications yet.

* The goal of this activity is to be able to learn how to leverage the current state of the community standards when developing ideas or implementing blockchain technologies. By getting comfortable exploring the standards, you will be able to keep up with the latest developments in the ecosystem and know that your implementations will be compatible with the community.

* Don't be intimidated by the fancy language, and if you really don't understand something, try to check out another standard or do some quick Googling!
