  **Potential Answers**

  * **BAT** - seeking to address fraud in advertising, basic attention is an open-source, decentralized ad platform that allows advertisers to pay website publishers for the attention of users.

  * **0x** - a protocol that allows the creation of decentralized crypto exchanges on the Ethereum blockchain using smart contracts for negotiation between users.

  * **Tether (USDT)** - is a controversial token that was one of the original stablecoins. Each `USDT` is backed by either a United States Dollar or a Loan and is managed by the Tether company.

  * **Hedge** - a platform that creates a market for knowledge on best trading practices, allows users to trade their current market analysis for an equivalent amount of value.

  * **Vechain** - "VeChain offers a Blockchain-as-a-Service (`BaaS`) platform called ToolChain. ToolChain offerers services like product lifecycle management, supply chain process control, data deposit, data certification, and process certification to enterprise companies like Walmart.

  * **Maker Dao (Dai)** - Dai is a token but also a `stablecoin`, this means 1 Dai = $1. Instead of having a central company back the fiat, the MakerDAO converts Ether to the Dai stablecoin. This creates a 1:1 parity with the USD, without a central authority, just smart contracts!

  * **Golem (GNT)** - is a token that you use to pay for rentable computing power on the Golem network. It allows you to pay for computations that occur outside of Ethereum, like GPU access or other hardcore number-crunching jobs.
