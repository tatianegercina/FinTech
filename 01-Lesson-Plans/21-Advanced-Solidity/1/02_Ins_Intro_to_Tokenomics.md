### 2. Instructor Do: Intro to Tokenomics (10 min)

This activity will introduce the idea of `Tokenomics,` the nature of tokens on the blockchain and what gives them value, the loose definitions of coins and tokens, as well as several examples.

Begin by giving the students some background on tokens and how they can be utilized within a blockchain platform to represent an asset, digital or physical.

* Tokens are used to represent an asset or utility on a blockchain platform.

* You can tokenize things like gold, silver, the USD, real-estate, your car, artwork, property, and virtually anything that holds some value.

* Since tokens are built using smart contracts they can be programmed to do many things besides just payments.

* By tokenizing things, we can make representing and trading value extremely easy and efficient. Since they are blockchain powered, these tokens can be traded globally without any additional infrastructure.

* Representing commodities as tokens allows for easy transportation of ownership. For example, transferring a metric ton of gold takes a lot of energy. Sending tokens representing that metric ton of gold is much easier, and allows for the same borderless nature given by the blockchain.

* Imagine opening up your cryptowallet to see all the various assets you own in a single place, digital and physical. You could manage your house ownership, car payments, artwork, investments, video game items, and more with cryptographically provable math.

* Business assets can easily be tracked and transferred, dramatically improving liquidity and auditability.

* Items you purchase at a grocery store can even be tokenized, allowing you to scan a code on your groceries to pull up the entire supply chain history of that item, allowing you to prove exactly where it came from.

* Stablecoins are tokens designed to have stable value; unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, they are not as volatile since they are backed by fiat (government) currencies.

* Stablecoins normally hold USD within bank accounts and then issue tokens backed by these dollars.

Clarify that `coins` are the cryptocurrencies native to the blockchain, coins like `BTC` and `ETH`, while `tokens` are generally built on top of existing blockchain platforms.

Additionally, clarify that the previous statement is a loose definition, and you may hear people using the terms coin and token interchangeably.

Now it's time for students to explore some tokens themselves!
