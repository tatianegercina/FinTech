### 15. Students Do: Exploring Common Smart Contract Vulnerabilities (SWCs) (10 min)

In this activity, students will use the remaining time to explore the most common smart contract vulnerabilities by checking out the [SWC Registry](https://swcregistry.io/) and the [SWC Coverage](https://mythx.io/swc-coverage/) that MythX supports.

**Instructions:**

* [README.md](Activities/15-Stu_SWC_Exploration/README.md)

Have TAs circulate the room and ensure that students are looking at example code and trying to understand the different vulnerabilities they are researching.

Some vulnerabilities may be very complex or low-level, encourage the students to dig deeper into a concept they uncover that they don't understand by researching more examples online.

If students get too confused, have them move onto other vulnerabilities and have them take a step back and slow down, or practice working with the example code in Remix.

### 16. Instructor Do: Review SWCs (5 min)

Ask the students the following questions:

* What was the most interesting vulnerability you found?

* Why might some vulnerabilities be suppported by the free version of MythX and some require Pro?

  **Answer:** Some analysis takes more computation and time, which costs MythX more.

  **Answer:** Other tools may be used besides the open source tools that MythX makes available.

* Why is it useful to be able to explore a registry of vulnerabilities like the SWC?

  **Answer:** The ability to identify vulnerabilities in code by recognizing a pattern is extremely useful when developing software.

  **Answer:** By having a list that contains example code and an identifiable SWC number, one can practice avoiding the vulnerabilities before having a tool identify them.

### 17. Instructor Do: Career Services (35 min)

This section is reserved for the Career Services portion of the class.
