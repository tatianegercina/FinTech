### 2. Instructor Do: Crowdsales in Ethereum (10 min)

In this activity you will explain how crowdsales have become a very popular method for distributing tokens.

* For companies and startups its cheap to have new ideas but executing those ideas can be very expensive.

* Over the last decade `crowdfunding` has become a popularized way for projects to receive funding that enables them to successfully bring their product or service to production.

* `Crowdfunding` is the process of raising funds by asking a large number of people each for a small amount of money. Crowdfunding is often done through a `crowdfunding platform` where users are promised a product or service and can then donate money to a project in a stream-lined manner.

* Blockchain technologies and the rise of tokenomics has enabled a new form of `crowdfunding` known as a `crowdsale`.

* Unlike in traditional crowdfunding backers funding the project are not promised a particular product or service. They are instead promised a given number of tokens at a set price.

* The tokens sold during the `crowdsale` then serve as a way for users to take part in whatever product or service the company is planning to launch.

Pose the class the following question:

* What are some things that crowdsale funds could be used for?

  * Marketing funds

  * To pay developers

  * Product development

  * Product production

  * Any other initial operating costs

Explain to the class that tokenomics still plays a huge rule in `crowdsales`. Investors backing the project aren't always just buying the token because they believe the future project will be successful but also because they believe the perceived market value of the token will increase.
