# Exploring Common Smart Contract Vulnerabilities

In this activity, you will check out the common vulnerabilities in smart contract development, and exploring example code.

## Instructions

* Navigate to the [SWC Registry](https://swcregistry.io/) and the [SWC Coverage](https://mythx.io/swc-coverage/) that MythX supports.

* Scroll through the registry by clicking on the `Registry` button at the top right.

  * You can start with [SWC-100](https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-100), which describes potential dangers when not setting your function's visibility properly (public, private, internal, external).

* As you explore the list, check back with the [SWC Coverage](https://mythx.io/swc-coverage/) that MythX supports, and explore them in the registry.

## Challenge

* Cross-check the MythX tool with the example code given for vulnerable contracts in the SWC Registry.

* If time remains, try to exploit a contract given the example code that the registry provides in Remix!
