## 17.1 Lesson Plan: Project Work

### Overview

Most of this class will center on project work. You and the TAs should check up on each group and make sure they're moving smoothly toward Saturday's presentations.

##### Instructor Priorities

* Students should have the entirety of class to work on their projects.

* Make sure your students make measurable progress with their project work.

##### Instructor Notes

Your students will be nearing the end of their projects. Even though it's the beginning of the week, you should push students to finish their apps before Thursday so they have optimum time to practice their presentations.

It's crucial that you steer any off-course projects back on track. Come next class, the encroaching Saturday deadline will mire any attempt at a turnaround.

The remaining schedule for Project 2 is as follows:

* Day 4 (today) and Day 5:

  * Students are given all of class to work on projects.

* Day 6:

  * Students present their projects!

### Class Objectives

* Students work on their group projects.

### 1. Welcome Class (5 min)

Say your hellos and check if students have any questions about past concepts.

### 2. Instructor Do: Ask About Projects (5 min)

Tell your students how you're excited to see the projects they'll present on Saturday. You should talk about how you're impressed with the concepts they've come up with and that they should feel proud about working toward the goals they devised after spending just eight weeks in this course.

Ask the class about their thoughts on the collaboration experience so far and about any lingering sources of anxiety they might have as they near closer to presentation day.

* Answer these reassuringly—if you ever had similar doubts, chime in with your experiences on overcoming them.

* If no one says anything, they're likely apprehensive about admitting fears to their classmates. Assure them that if they're anxious about their project work, then no doubt other students feel the same way. Encourage them to share these thoughts—talking about them is an essential step to overcoming them.

### 3. Student Do: Project Work (1 hour, 20 minutes)

Have your students sit with their project groups. Tell the class they should try as best they can to finish 95% of their code and design by the end of the next class. That would give them most of Thursday and Friday to spend on presentations.

Add that they should come into the next class expecting to devote at least 30 minutes to outlining their presentations. They'll also have time to work on the rest of their project.

TAs and instructors: For the next 90 minutes, you're senior developers! Walk around the class as mentors for each group's team. Ask them about their progress so far; offer them advice on how they can finish their work in time.

* Maybe a member of the team finished all the work their role entailed. Perhaps they're waiting for other people to complete a certain task before they can continue. Make sure any students in these situations ask their teammates how else they can help.

* Some students might be stumped by technology that they hadn't gone over in class but are trying to use in their project. See if you can help out. If you're not familiar with the tech, direct the encumbered student to someone on the Boot Camp team who is.

* In any case, make sure all teams seem prepared to complete their projects by Saturday.
