# Payments Ordered By

In this activity, you will use `ORDER BY` in combination with other SQL methods to query and order the `payment` table.

## Instructions

1. Find the count of payments per customer in descending order

2. Find the top 5 customers who have spend the most money

3. Find the bottom 5 customers who have spend the least money

## Bonus

Using the `CAST()` function, cast the `payment_date` as a DATE datatype to group by day (rather than date and time). Determine the count of payments per day in descending order.
