## A View with a Roomful of Queries

In this activity, you will work with a partner to practice your join and subquery skills, as well as build out a view.

### Instructions

* Write a query to get the number of payments and total payment amount for each customer in the `payment` table. Make sure to pull the customer `first_name` and `last_name` from the `customer` table via a `JOIN`.

  * The results should look similar to the following image.
