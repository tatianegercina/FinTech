# Gregarious Aggregates

In this activity, you will practice writing queries with aggregate functions, grouping, and using aliases.

## Instructions

Use the `payment` table to answer the following questions:

1. What is the average payment amount?

2. What is the total payment amount?

3. What is the minimum payment amount?

4. What is the maximum payment amount?

5. What is the count of payments for each customer?

6. How many customers has each staff serviced?

## Hint

Consult the Postgres documentation on [aggregate functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/functions-aggregate.html) for a summary of the available functions.
