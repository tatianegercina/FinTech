# Subqueries

In this activity, you will practice creating subqueries.

## Instructions

Use the `payment`, `customer`, and `rental` tables to answer the following subquery questions:

1. Find the customer records of those who have made payments.

2. Find the staff records of those who have helped customers make payments.

3. Find the rental records of all films that have been paid for.

## Bonus

Use the `payment`, `rental`, `inventory`, and `film` tables to find the film records of films that have been rented out and paid for.

**Hint:** You will need to use multiple nested subqueries.
