# Data Relationships

In this activity, you will implement a many-to-many relationship with the help of a junction table.

## Instructions

You are a database consultant at a national real estate firm. Your job is to design a database model for the real estate agents and their designated regions. The database will keep track of information on agents, regions in which the firm operates, and the regions each real estate agent is assigned.

* Begin by creating a new database named `agent_db`.

* Create a `agent` table that keeps track of the following:

  * Unique ID number of each agent.

  * First and last names of each agent.

* Create a `region` table that keeps track of the following:

  * Unique ID number of each region.

  * Name of each region.

* Create a `agent_region_junction` table that keeps track of the following:

  * All regions that have been assigned to each agent.

* Determine the data model that is appropriate here: one to one, one to many, or many to many.
