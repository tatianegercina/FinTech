## Data Modeling

In this activity, you will design a database model.

### Instructions

You are the database consultant at a new university. Your job is to design a database model for the registrar. The database will keep track of information on students, courses offered by the university, and the courses each student has taken.

* Begin by creating a new database named `university_db`.

* Create a `students` table that keeps track of the following:

  * Unique ID number of each student

  * Last and first names of each student

* Create a `courses` table that keeps track of the following:

  * Unique ID number of each course

  * Name of each course

* Create a `student_courses_junction` that keeps track of the following:

  * All courses that have been taken by each student

  * Term in which a course was taken by a student (spring or fall)

* Determine the data model that is appropriate here: one to one, one to many, or many to many.

### Bonus

**Note:** Complete the bonus if time allows.

Join and query the tables to get all data on the students.
