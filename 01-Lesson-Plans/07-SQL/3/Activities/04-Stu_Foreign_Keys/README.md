# Foreign Keys

In this activity, you will create and populate two new tables with foreign keys that reference existing data.

## Instructions

**Note:** Make sure all tables have primary keys that increment with each new row of data.

Complete the following:

* Create an `owners` table with an owner `first_name` and `last_name`.

* Create a `estates` table with a foreign key that references a field in the original `owners` table.

* Test foreign keys by writing a query to insert data in the `estates` table that does not have a reference ID in the `owners` table.

* Join the two tables.

## Hint

Think about how you can select certain columns in a table. Use those columns as a reference to insert data into a table.
