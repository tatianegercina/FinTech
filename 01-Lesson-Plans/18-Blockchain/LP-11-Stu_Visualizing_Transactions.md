### 11. Student Do: Visualizing Transactions (10 mins)

For this activity, students will visualize transactions using the same technique used in the demo.

Students will get into small groups and will explore the blockchain using Etherscan together.

Have TAs circulate to provide assistance to students facing challenges or to clarify the role of each student.

**Instructions:**

* [README.md](Activities/11-Stu_Visualizing_Transactions/README.md)

### 12. Instructor Do: Visualizing Transactions Review (5 mins)

Review the groups and ensure that students can navigate and visualize transactions.

Recap by asking the students to answer these questions:

* "What is a transaction hash?"

* "What type of information is available to you on a public blockchain's block explorer?"

  **Answer** Practically everything, balances, transaction history, data stored on chain, etc.

* "Is this a fully anonymous blockchain?"

  **Answer** No, the current version of the public Ethereum network is pseudonymous, not fully anonymous yet.

Explain to the class that while the current version of Ethereum is pseudonymous, future updates will bring a technology
called "Zero Knowledge Proofs" that will enable completely private transactions on a public network.
This means that the balances and transaction history between accounts will be encrypted in a way that allows
for verification without exposing potentially sensitive information.

This means that in the future, transactions will be private, and you will only be able to view transactions that you are a part of.
There are currently public blockchains like Zcash that implement this now by default, so be on the look out for zero knowledge protocols
in future blockchain upgrades.
