### 10. Instructor Do: Block Explorers Demo (10 minutes)

The goal of this demo is to show the students how block explorers can be used to visualize transactions on the blockchain.

Open [this link](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0xc3879b456daa348a16b6524cbc558d2cc984722c) to the Ropsten Etherscan block explorer.

This has an address pre-populated, but it is recommended to use an account that you own and have made the transactions personally.

* Point out the balance field. Reflect that this is part of the public nature of blockchains, and some blockchains have this field hidden.

* Scroll through the list of transactions that this account has made. Ask the students if any of these fields stand out in particular, and why?

* Point out the "Transaction Hash" column on the very left.

* Click on a transaction hash for any of the transactions.

* Ask the students what they think a transaction hash might be, and what it might be used for.

  * **Answer**: The transaction hash is used as the unique ID of the transaction to find it later.

* Go back to the initial address page, then click on the "block number" section of a transaction

* Point out the fields "Mined By" and "Block Reward" and explain that this is the address of the miner that successfully created this block
  and received that amount of Ether as reward.

* Click on the "Transactions" button to view which transactions were mined in that block.

* Explain that these are the transactions that were mined in this particular block:

Have a student volunteer to send out the transaction hash of a recent transcation made to a fellow student.

Walk through the student's recent transactions and point out the "from", "to", and "amount" fields and verify this with the students that these transactions ocurred between.

Ask the students to point out any fields that may confuse them or that they are curious about.
If they point out the following terms, reassure them that they will be explained in greater detail later:

* Difficulty

* Gas

* Gas Limit

* Nonce
