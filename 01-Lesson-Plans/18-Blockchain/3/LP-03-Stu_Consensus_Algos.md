### 3. Students Do: Turn and Teach Consensus Algorithms (10 min)

Students will now turn and teach the three consensus algorithms just covered.

Have the students get into groups of 3 (one student per algorithm).

**Instructions:**

* [README.md](Activities/03-Stu_Consensus_Algos/README.md)

Have TAs circulate and ensure that students are actively engaging in discussion.

### 4. Instructor Do: Consensus Algorithm Review (5 min)

Ask the students the following questions:

* What is the biggest strength of:

  * Proof of Work

    **Answer**: Most secure, most decentralized.

  * Proof of Stake

    **Answer**: Similar security as PoW without the electricity cost.

  * Proof of Authority

    **Answer**: Fastest, great for testing and development.

* What is the biggest weakness of:

  * Proof of Work

    **Answer**: High energy/computational cost.

  * Proof of Stake

    **Answer**: Potential wealth distribution issues, incentive structure can possibly be taken advantage of.

  * Proof of Authority

    **Answer**: Highly centralized, least secure.
