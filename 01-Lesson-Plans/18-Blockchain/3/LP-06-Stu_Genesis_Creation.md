### 6. Students Do: Creating a Genesis Block (10 min)

Students will create their own genesis configuration just like was demonstrated.

**Instructions:**

* [README.md](Activities/06-Stu_Genesis_Creation/README.md)

Have the TAs circulate and ensure that the students are able to get to the "successful genesis creation" message.

### 7. Instructor Do: Review Genesis Configuration (5 min)

Ensure that every student has seen the success message for creating a new genesis configuration.

If a student is stuck, have either a TA or fellow student help get them un-stuck.

Ask the students:

* What is important about the genesis block?

  **Answer**: It contains the initial rules for the blockchain network, like consensus algorithm, pre-funded accounts, etc.

Once every student has seen the success message, you can move on.
