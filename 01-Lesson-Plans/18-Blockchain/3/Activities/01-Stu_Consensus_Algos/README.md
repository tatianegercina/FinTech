# Turn and Teach: Consensus Algorithms

In this activity, you will get with a group of three and review the pros and cons of the consensus algorithms you just learned!

## Instructions

* Get into groups of three.

* Each member should pick an algorithm to research and explain to the group.

* Take turns explaining the pros and cons of the algorithm you chose to the rest of the group.

* Make sure to discuss the biggest strength and biggest weakness of each algorithm.

* Fill in the table below:

  Name               | Strength | Weakness
  -------------------|----------|----------
  Proof of Work      |          |
  Proof of Stake     |          |
  Proof of Authority |          |

## Challenge

* If time remains, try discussing any other consensus algorithms you may have heard about or studied and the tradeoffs they make.
