# Turn and Teach: Consensus Algorithms

In this activity, you will get with a group of 3 and review the pros and cons of the 3 consensus algorithms you just learned!

## Instructions

* Get into groups of 3.

* Each member pick an algorithm to explain.

* Take turns explaining the pros and cons of the algorithm you chose to the rest of the group.

* Make sure to discuss the biggest strength and biggest weakness of each algorithm.

* Fill in the table below:

  Name | Strength | Weakness
  ---------|----------|---------
  Proof of Work | |
  Proof of Stake | |
  Proof of Authority | |

## Challenge

* If time remains, try discussing any other consensus algorithms you may have heard about or studied and the tradeoffs they make.
