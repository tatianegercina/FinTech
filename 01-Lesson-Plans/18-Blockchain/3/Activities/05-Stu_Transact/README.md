# Transacting on your chain

In this activity, you will be connecting MyCrypto to your custom chain, importing your pre-funded wallet, then sending a test transaction to yourself!

## Instructions

First, you will need to get the private key of your pre-funded address and keep it handy for later.

* Open up MyCrypto to get the private key of the ETH address you use to pre-fund your chain. Be sure the `Kovan` network is selected.

* Unlock your wallet using your mnemonic phrase and choose the address you want to inspect.

* Select the ETH address you use to pre-fund your chain, and in the "Select" dropdown list, choose `Wallet Info`.

* Click on the eye icon next to the `Private Key` field, and copy and paste the private key of the wallet. Keep this handy, as you will use it in a bit.

Now you are going to connect MyCrypto with the blockchain you created. Follow the next steps.

* Open up MyCrypto, then click `Change Network` at the bottom left:

* Click "Add Custom Node", then add the custom network information that you set in the genesis.

* Make sure that you scroll down to choose `Custom` in the "Network" column to reveal more options like `Chain ID`:

* The chain ID must match what you came up with earlier.

* The URL is pointing to the default RPC port on your local machine. Use `http://127.0.0.1:8545`.

* Once you save and use the network, double-check that it is selected and is connected.

Now that you are connected to your blockchain, you will need to load a private key that you created and funded on the network.

* If you are logged in to another wallet, you'll need to click `Change Wallet` on the top right, but make sure you are connected to your custom network:

* On the left pane menu, click on "View & Send".

* Next, click on the "Private Key" option to continue.

* A new window will pop-up, paste the private key of the pre-fund wallet and click on the "Unlock" button to continue.

* Looks like we're filthy rich! This is the balance that was pre-funded for this account in the genesis configuration; however, these millions of ETH tokens are just for testing purposes.

Now we're going to send a transaction to ourselves to test it out. Follow the next steps.

* Copy the pre-fund address into the "To Address" field, then fill in an arbitrary amount of ETH:

* Confirm the transaction by clicking "Send Transaction", and the "Send" button in the pop-up window.

* Click the `Check TX Status` when the green message pops up, confirm the logout:

* You should see the transaction go from `Pending` to `Successful` in around the same block time you set in the genesis.

* You can click the `Check TX Status` button to update the status.

Congratulations! That was the first transaction sent on this blockchain network!
