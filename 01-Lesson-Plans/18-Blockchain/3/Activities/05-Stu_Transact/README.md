# Transacting on your chain

In this activity, you will be connecting MyCrypto to your custom chain, importing your pre-funded wallet, then sending a test transaction to yourself!

## Instructions

* Open up MyCrypto to get the private key of the ETH address you use to pre-fund your chain. Be sure the `Kovan` network is selected.

* Unlock your wallet using your mnemonic phrase and choose the address you want to inspect.

* Select the ETH address you use to pre-fund your chain, and in the "Select" dropdown list, choose "Wallet Info.

* Click on the eye icon next to the "Private Key" field, and copy and paste the private key of the wallet.

Now you are going to connect MyCrypto with the blockchain you created. Follow the next steps.

* Open up MyCrypto, then click `Change Network` at the bottom left:

* Click "Add Custom Node", then add the custom network information that you set in the genesis.

* Make sure that you scroll down to choose `Custom` in the "Network" column to reveal more options like `Chain ID`:

* The chain ID must match what you came up with earlier.

* The URL is pointing to the default RPC port on your local machine. Use `http://127.0.0.1:8545`.

* Once you save and use the network, double-check that it is selected and is connected.

Open the wallet that you use to pre-fund the chain during genesis creation as follows:

* On the left pane menu, click on "View & Send".

* Next, click on the "Private Key" option to continue.

* A new window will pop-up, paste the private key of the pre-fund wallet and click on the "Unlock" button to continue.

* Looks like we're filthy rich! This is the balance that was pre-funded for this account in the genesis configuration; however, these millions of ETH tokens are just for testing purposes.

Explain to students that now we're going to send a transaction to ourselves to test it out. Follow the next steps.

* Copy the pre-fund address into the "To Address" field, then fill in an arbitrary amount of ETH:

* Confirm the transaction by clicking "Send Transaction", and the "Send" button in the pop-up window.

* Click the `Check TX Status` when the green message pops up, confirm the logout:

* You should see the transaction go from `Pending` to `Successful` in around the same block time you set in the genesis.

* You can click the `Check TX Status` button to update the status.

Congratulations! That was the first transaction send on this blockchain network!
