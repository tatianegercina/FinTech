### Instructor Do: LinkedIn Powerpoint (15 min)

**Slides:** [Employer Competitive Linkedin](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zlnuUVMoA2T1S6RdGo8CchwZNB5F_E_DkrGLlINRlDY/edit?usp=sharing)

Whether students are transitioning into a career in FinTech or already work in FinTech, they will need to update their LinkedIn profiles with the new skillset that they’ve acquired in class. This LinkedIn presentation will focus specifically on how to make LinkedIn employer-ready for the FinTech industry. Employer research shows two-thirds of employers recommend having a LinkedIn profile. The FinTech industry is new, so the majority of employers look for candidates who have a data background and a passion for finance when hiring. If you can display this on your LinkedIn profile, you are more likely to get noticed by recruiters.

The FinTech: An Employer-Competitive LinkedIn Profile PowerPoint walks through all the important components of an employer-driven LinkedIn.

**Profile picture:** Every student should have a profile picture on their LinkedIn. Each profile picture should follow the following criteria:

* Solid background: A solid background promotes professionalism. White helps the candidate stick out. Stay away from darker colors like black or dark reds and blues.

* Approachable pose: Make sure candidates look approachable. A great smile in a profile picture means recruiters are more likely to respond because they see someone who can be a part of the team they are building.

* Size: All LinkedIn pictures should be 400x400 pixels to fit properly.

Edit a profile picture by going to the bio section and clicking on the pencil. If there is time,  students can fix their profile picture in class. Have students stand in front of a white wall and have peers take their pictures using a smartphone. Make sure that students are dressed professionally—emphasize professional wear before they do this.

**Career summary:** A career summary is a great place for students to introduce their passion for the FinTech industry. Most employers are looking for candidates who have a strong data background and an affinity for finance. A career summary has the following components:

* Introduction to the candidate’s professional background.

* Experience level.

* The value the candidate hopes to bring to the team.

* A demonstration of the candidate’s passion for finance.

The following career summary covers the bullet points mentioned above. Feel free to break down the career summary and match up each bullet point to each section of the career summary.

**Work experience:** Students might have questions about how to word their previous work experience onto a LinkedIn profile. This answer will vary based on the type of student.

* Transitioning from a different career: A student who is completely new to the FinTech industry is going to want to focus on the projects that are being done in class as their professional background. While interviewing, they can refer to their classroom projects as projects.

* Previous FinTech experience: An experienced student will want to add to the skill set already on their LinkedIn profiles by highlighting projects and emphasizing new technologies they might not have previously included. They also might want to add sentences that revolve around a passion for finance.

Once students identify who they are and what goals they want to accomplish with their LinkedIn profiles, they can adjust their work experience accordingly. Students who are new to the field might want to make an “additional experience” section and add any jobs that don’t directly relate to finance.

**Education:** It’s important to add certifications to a LinkedIn profile. Students will want to include the following components:

* School name

* Degree or certification received

* Dates

This should include a short description listing everything accomplished in class. Have them add as many keywords as possible so recruiters can find their profiles.

**Skills:** The skills section also should include keywords that can help recruiters find candidate profiles. Make sure that students add all the tech skills that they are comfortable with adding to their LinkedIn. The skills below are tech skills that they will have acquired by the end of the class. If students want to add skills that they have not yet acquired yet, that’s OK. They can mention to recruiters that by the end of class they will have mastered these skills:

_Python, Python APIs, Python Visualization libraries, Plotly.py, time series analysis and prediction, SQL, natural language processing, Amazon Web Services, SageMaker, Lex, algorithmic trading (trading bot), machine learning, Scikit-Learn, robo advising, blockchain, cryptocurrency, blockchain with Python, Solidity, smart contracts._

Make sure students do not forget to add any soft skills they have acquired in previous jobs that can help them stick out when they are looking for a position.

### Student Do: LinkedIn Update (20 min)

Give students 20 minutes to open up their LinkedIn profiles and make any updates that need to be made. After they’ve updated their profiles, have them connect to at least five people in the class. Give them the option to write letters of recommendation that are FinTech-related for their peers. This will help them become employer-competitive when job searching.

After students feel confident in their LinkedIn profiles, have them submit their profiles for review by a profile coach to Milestone 5 in the Career Services tab in BCS.
