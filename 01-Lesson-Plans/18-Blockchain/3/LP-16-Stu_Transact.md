### 16. Students Do: Transacting on their chains (15 min)

Now it's time for the students to connect MyCrypto to their chain and send a transaction!

**Instructions:**

* [README.md](Activities/16-Stu_Transact/README.md)

Have the TAs circulate and ensure that students are successfully connecting MyCrypto to their
second RPC-enabled node and sending a transaction from a prefunded account.

### 17. Instructor Do: Recap and Troubleshooting (35 min)

Take this time to troubleshoot and ensure that the students are successfully transacting.

Ensure that:

* Students are connecting MyCrypto to `http://127.0.0.1:8545` in the custom network.

* The chain ID matches their genesis configuration.

* The account being used is the one that the student prefunded in their genesis configuration.

* Their chain is still running:

  * One node is mining.

  * One node is RPC enabled.
