### 15. Student Do: Use Case Brainstorm (15 mins)

Now that the students have learned about the features of Ethereum and how it acts as a decentralized world computer,
it is a good time to brainstorm different use cases given these features.

Students will get into groups and come up with different decentralized application ideas, as well as discuss dapps
they may be familiar with.

Have TAs circulate throughout the class, facilitating discussion and ensuring students are not lost.

**Instructions:**

* [README.md](1/Activities/15-Stu_Use_Case_Brainstorm/README.md)

### 16. Instructor Do: Use Case Review (10 mins)

Ask different groups what their most interesting use case was and have them describe them to the class.

Facilitate the discussion toward the benefits of decentralizing certain applications.

* What are the main benefits of decentralizing your application?

  **Answer** The application can only go down if the entire Ethereum network goes down.

  **Answer** The application can run without a central server.

  **Answer** The application could potentially live forever (as long as Ethereum exists).

  **Answer** The application is pay-per-use, much like a decentralized AWS Lambda.

* If the students chose a game-based use case, ask what type of assets they have represented?

* Is there a limit to what you can build with Ethereum's Turing complete smart contracts?

  **Answer** No, in theory, you could build any application just as you would with any other general purpose programming language.

Reinforce the idea that Ethereum's smart contracts are just programs that run on a distributed, decentralized computer.
Anyone can upload and pay to run code in a secure sandboxed compute environment, allowing for a more secure, immutable web,
and for building powerful financial applications.
