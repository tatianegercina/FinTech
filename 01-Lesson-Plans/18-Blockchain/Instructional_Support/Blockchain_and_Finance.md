## Blockchain in the Finance Realm Today

With news about cryptocurrency exchange and wallet hacks, scandals, and dirty money, it’s easy to become skeptical about how meaningful blockchain and cryptocurrency is to the broader world of FinTech, or whether it’s a passing fad. 

However, although over the next decade blockchain terminology and use-cases will certainly change, the technology behind it is, as of now, being put to practice. Ironically, what once was originally an obscure way to launder money, cryptocurrency is now being adopted by large, heavily regulated banks. JP Morgan, for example, has “forked” (or employed the base code of) a version of Solidity (a cryptocurrency language that we learn in this module), in order to create [its own digital coin](https://www.jpmorgan.com/global/news/digital-coin-payments) and blockchain based payment network, called “JPM Coin.” As of the end of 2019, just 9 months after JP Morgan’s announcement, more than 80 Japanese banks—which in deposit terms, represents nearly the entire banking system of the country—expressed [a willingness to use the coin](https://www.paymentssource.com/articles/money-laundering-battle-drives-japan-banks-to-jpmorgans-network). (Incidentally, for reasons of reducing money laundering risk in the country).

The SWIFT network, which is a little known entity that plays a [dominant role](https://www.swift.com/about-us) in the global flow of money, has also just developed The Global Payments Initiative, which is essentially a blockchain that member banks can query using an API to instantly verify the validity of a cross-border transaction. This has the potential to bring down transaction times for all large global transaction flows to [near instantaneous speed](https://www.swift.com/our-solutions/swift-gpi), wheareas they had previously taken a few days to process.

Even central banks (the monetary authorities of each country—in the United States this is the Federal Reserve, but each country has its own) are adopting blockchain technology. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, for example, has just created a blockchain-based trade finance platform. This is not a currency, but it uses blockchain to help solve a major source of inefficiency in world trade: cross payment transfers for imports and exports.

Historically, trade finance (or the process of financing the sale and payment of goods that gets shipped overseas) is a long process involving multiple banks, the geo-tracking of shipments, and complicated payment terms between a customer and supplier. A typical transaction would involve, for example, a supplier only receiving payment (via a cross-border bank transfer) once the customer has physically received the container from off the ship, and once the shipping company provided physical confirmation documents, but *only* with that payment to occur 60 days from that confirmation date. Sounds complicated! Worse, most of these transactions still involve all parties (banks, supplier, customer, shipping line) each having to receive and sign with (gasps) *physical paper*.

By contrast, blockchain technology allows these complicated conditional (“only-if” received, "then pay" when) procedures and payments involving to be automatically codified as “smart” contracts. Moreover, such contracts are electronic—meaning they are instantaneously verifiable by all involved parties. Currently, [Hong Kong is working with counterparts](https://www.hkma.gov.hk/eng/news-and-media/speeches/2019/11/20191106-1/) in Europe, Singapore, Mainland China, and Thailand to implement and refine this digital solution to an ancient problem.

In sum, while most of the headline media focuses of issues like crypto-exchange hacks, the price of Bitcoin, or even the true identity of its mysterious founder, these types of headlines are really just a distraction relative to how the underlying technology is  disrupting the way payments processing—the “bread and butter” backbone of economies—is being designed and executed.

Furthermore, beyond government-owned central banks, mega-banks, and established payment processors, many technology firms are adopting blockchain technology, and some FinTech firms are making it the [outright core of their business model](https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/hubs/org_num/blockchain-startups). Thus, in the spirit of detailing the more diverse ways cryptocurrency is being credibly applied to FinTech, the following section lists and describes a number of  such firms. Annual venture capital investment flow into the blockchain sector is large, at about $2 billion per year, but listed below is what's happening with about a billion dollars worth of recent VC investment. Which one do you think will become the next unicorn?

## Firms

  * Eye-wateringly high interest rates on consumer loans throughout South America are a common sight. This FinTech company offers consumers in Brazil near immediate loans at an interest rate lower than local banks, along with a credit scoring service and financial advice for borrowers. These borrowing contracts are underwritten by blockchain technology. Underscoring the dramatic demand for these types of products in emerging economies with concentrated lending industries, the company has already received more than $1 billion USD in loan requests.


* [Ripple Labs](https://ripple.com/) ([Crunchbase funding](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ripple-labs): >59M; although the founder's stake [appears to be worth roughly $37.3 billion](https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2018/01/02/meet-the-crypto-billionaires-getting-rich-from-ripples-xrp/#1826ac383289))
  * According to Ripple, the company "offers a global real-time payment system that enables banks and financial institutions around the world to directly transact with each other without the need for a central correspondent. The company also offers FX Market Making, a solution enabling enterprises to gain access to cross-currency liquidity through a distributed network that allows foreign exchange to be externally sourced from a competitive FX marketplace or an internal FX trading desk. This minimizes FX exposure thereby lowering the volatility and counter-party risk of trades."

  * Mythical is a game technology firm, that "believes that true ownership of digital assets, verifiable scarcity, and integrated secondary markets will spawn a new generation of games". Basically, the firm is trying to create a common digital currency that can be transferrable across different games. Given the growth of in-game currencies (think: World of Warcraft), it's a space with big potential, and Mythical [isn't the only firm attempting to use blockchain](https://forte.io/) to capitalize on it.

* [Bakkt](https://www.bakkt.com/) ([Crunchbase funding](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bakkt#section-overview): 182.5M)
  * Bakkt does a number of things, as evidenced by its funding size. This includes being part of the backbone behind cryptocurrency futures trading, but its also an attempt to fit cryptocurrency within existing regulatory frameworks, and enable more investors, merchants, and consumers to use digital currency.

* [Acronis](https://www.acronis.com/en-us/cyber-protection/) ([Crunchbase funding](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/acronis#section-overview): 158M; valuation more than $1 Billion)
  * Among other cyber-security business lines, the company provides blockchain-based data authentication. 







## More on Blockchain and Central Banking
Central banks, for a variety of reasons, manage the supply and demand of their country’s currency. They keep prices of things one can buy with that currency stable (i.e., prevent inflation in the prices of goods), and change the supply of their currency in order to stimulate or cool down the economy when needed, so as to keep an economy moving along in a healthy fashion and to avoid or at least delay recessions as much as possible. Simply put, this control of money’s supply and demand is designed to stabilize economies. 

Therefore, although many central banks are excited about the technological advances behind blockchain, they worry somewhat about what might happen if adoption of crypto or alternative digital currencies becomes widespread. After all, if no one is there to influence the supply and demand for a currency when it is needed, how can inflation be avoided and the impact of recessions minimized?

Despite fears about a lack of regulation and oversight, in practice, most central banks are curious about the possibility of blockchain and digital currency, or even enthusiastic adopters. As mentioned above, The Hong Kong central bank is one of them, but The Bank of France (the central bank of France, which is part of the European Central Bank) is another, [having implemented a decentralized, blockchain solution](https://www.europeanpaymentscouncil.eu/news-insights/insight/madre-banque-de-france-blockchain-project) for its coordination of information sharing with banks. The central bank [intends to issue](https://cointelegraph.com/news/france-to-test-its-central-bank-digital-currency-in-q1-2020-official) a digital currency (for use among its member banks) in 2020.

If you’re interested in more detail on how central banks are exploring the possibility of blockchain, [here is a recent white paper](http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Central_Bank_Activity_in_Blockchain_DLT.pdf) by the World Economic Forum, which details how over a dozen different central banks are currently exploring the technological potential of blockchain (or aspects of blockchain) for the currencies that they manage. Related to that, the World Economic Forum also [maintains a curated list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c8iGtoG7BkPr-iufnIPELEWvtZiNtouOyJp2IYjhAEY/edit#) of “[w]hite papers, reports, and speeches related to the intersections of central banking, blockchain technology, and/or CBDC (central bank digital currencies).”

**Broadly, the white paper by the World Economic Forum highlights the following use-cases where one or more central banks today are actually using blockchain:**

 * Retail digital currency: A currency that is peer-to-peer and settled in a decentralized manner (meaning no banks in the middle).
 * A digital currency used just between the central bank and private banks (not household end users) that is also peer-to-peer and decentralized, that has faster transaction processing speed than the traditional set-up. 
 * Regulated securities settlement, where using smart contracts means that financial securities can transact (security for cash) instantaneously, instead of taking days to transfer.  
* Decentralized ledgers as a way to make the banking system more resilient to natural disasters, cyber or terror attacks.
 * Keeping track of government issued bonds, for which there are often thousands, all with varying maturity dates, contract terms, and investors.
 * Using blockchain to prevent money laundering (to create a digital “paper trail” to detect dodgy money)
  * General data sharing of large economic databases between the government and the private sector.
  * Trade finance: using smart, decentralized digital contracts to digitize what is currently a slow, complicated, and paper driven process underpinning world trade in physical goods.
* Safer identity recognition (decentralized systems for confirming and sharing identities) for when commercial and central banks do business with each other.  

That said, implementation of blockchain technology by central banks is not without its challenges. [These include the following](https://www.chicagofed.org/~/media/publications/economic-perspectives/2017/ep2017-7-pdf.pdf ):
* The need for consensus: by virtue of being decentralized, decision making to fundamentally change the technology could be slow or limited, as (in a fully permission-less network) all participants need to agree on the protocol change. 
* The uncertainty in how multiple blockchain systems could easily work together (how can a smart contract interact with a smart contract from another system?)
* The computational nature of many distributed systems means the potential for a requirement for large computing resources to maintain the system (the maintenance of Bitcoin, for example, is estimated to consume [about as much electricity](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-48853230) as the Country of Switzerland).
* The fact that once a transaction becomes added to the blockchain, it cannot be undone; that transactions cannot be reversed. 

These are largely technical challenges, that will likely by solved by future iterations of blockchain and distributed ledger technology. Other fundamental issues, however, such as a country’s regulatory control of its own currency, are likely to persist for some time.
