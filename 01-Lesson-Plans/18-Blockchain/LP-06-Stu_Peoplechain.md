### 6. Student Do: Peoplechain (15 mins)

For this activity, students will emulate the public, censor resistant and borderless nature of the blockchain by creating
a distributed ledger like system breaking up into groups and using themselves as network participants.

Have TAs circulate to provide assistance to students facing challenges or to clarify the role of each student.

You will need to group students into at least 3 groups:

- 1 group will create and send transactions
- 1 group will be a geographical region of "nodes"
- 1 group will be a second geographical region of "nodes"

Have the students pick which part of the world their group will be in.
