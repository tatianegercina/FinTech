### 6. Student Do: Peoplechain (15 mins)

For this activity, students will emulate the public, censor resistant and borderless nature of the blockchain by creating
a distributed ledger like system breaking up into groups and using themselves as network participants.

Have TAs circulate to provide assistance to students facing challenges or to clarify the role of each student.

You will need to group students into at least 3 groups:

- 1 group will create and send transactions
- 1 group will be a geographical region of "nodes"
- 1 group will be a second geographical region of "nodes"

Have the students pick which part of the world their group will be in.

### 7. Instructor Do: Peoplechain Review (5 mins)

Ask the students a few questions about the activity:

  * If one person lied about a transaction, would it be easy to tell?

    * **Answer**: Sure, you could double check with another ledger.

    * **Answer**: In reality, there are cryptographic features that will also prevent this.

  * What would you do if you discovered a ledger keeper was lying, or not responding?

    * **Answer** Take note and stop communicating with them.

    * **Answer** You might even tell others that they lied.

  * What are the ways this system is making lying harder to do?

    * **Answer** Since the ledger is everywhere, and transactions are broadcasted to everyone, it is difficult to lie.

Ask the students to ponder the following (no answer required):

  * While it may be easy to discover one node is lying, what if one entire region had a different copy of the ledger?

    * **Answer** You would have a consensus problem.
