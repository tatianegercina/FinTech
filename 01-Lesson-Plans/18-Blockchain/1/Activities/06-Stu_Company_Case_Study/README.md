# Company Case Study

Now that you have learned more about blockchain, it's time to think about companies that are using this technology to solve real world financial problems.

## Instructions

* Get into small groups of up to three people for discussion.

* Go to the example [JPM Coin Case Study](Resources/JPM_Coin_Case_Study.md) and read the case study to get a feel for what you'll need to research and describe.

* Then, choose a Canadian blockchain company to research and discuss with your group the following findings:

  * What the company is.
  
  * Why it matters that the company is using blockchain to tackle a financial problem.
  
  * Why the company is interesting.
  
## Hint

* Some may not directly reference concrete blockchain projects, so you'll want to focus more on the companies that have started implementations versus the ones supporting research and development.

* If you are not familiar with Canadian blockchain companies, you can review this list of the [Top Blockchain Developers in Canada](https://clutch.co/ca/developers/blockchain).
