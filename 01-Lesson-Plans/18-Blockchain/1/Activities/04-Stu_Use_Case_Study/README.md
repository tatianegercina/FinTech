# Use Case Study

In this activity, you will examine several cryptocurrency and blockchain use cases and curate a list of features that each have. This list will be used again later in class today.

## Instructions

* Get into a group of three or four.

* Each group member should pick a use case to read for a few minutes.

* While reading, make a list of the different features and functionality that you notice.

* Compare your lists to your group.

* Discuss the differences and similarities.

* Try to come up with a core set of features that all of the use cases share.
