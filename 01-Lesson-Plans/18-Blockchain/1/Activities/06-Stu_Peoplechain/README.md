The best way to understand how the blockchain keeps track of transactions is to emulate one!
As a class, you will be getting into groups that will each participate in the network in a different way.
This activity will demonstrate the public, borderless, and censor resistant nature of the blockchain.

## Instructions

1. Get into at least 3 groups. Each group should elect a student to create a Slack message between the rest of the group.

  * One group will create and send transactions

  * One group will be a geographical region of ledger keepers. Elect one member from this group to correspond with the other group of ledger keepers.

  * One group will be a second geographical region of ledger keepers. Elect one member from this group to correspond with the other group of ledger keepers.

2. If you are a part of the group of users that will create and send transactions, you will be doing the following:

  * Create a "transaction" by typing out an object that's formatted like this, but with your own custom values:

```json
{ to: "StudentA", from: "StudentB", amount: "$100", fee: "$1.00" }
```

  * Treat this as a transaction, and send it to one student from one group of ledger keepers.

  * Create another transaction, tweaking the parameters a bit. Send it to a different student from a different ledger group.

3. If you are part of a group of ledger keepers, you will be doing the following:

  * For every transaction that you receive, copy it down into a separate document outside of Slack.

  * Keep the transactions in order by the highest fee, then by the highest amount being sent.

  * Once you record the transaction to your "personal ledger" you should send the transaction to the rest of the students in your group.

  * If you are elected to correspond with the other ledger keeper group, send the transaction to one of the students from that group as well.

4. If all of these steps are properly followed, all of the ledger keeper groups should have the same list of transactions.

5. Compare ledgers to make sure that they are all "synchronized".

6. If they are not, take a note as to why. Was it because someone missed a transaction, or was a transaction actually modified?

7. Ask yourself, what were to happen if any of these students were to lie about the transactions they received?

  * Would it be easy to discover who is lying?

  * What would you do if you discovered a ledger keeper was lying, or not responding?

  * What are the ways this system is making lying harder to do?

  * While it may be easy to discover one node is lying, what if one entire region had a different copy of the ledger?
