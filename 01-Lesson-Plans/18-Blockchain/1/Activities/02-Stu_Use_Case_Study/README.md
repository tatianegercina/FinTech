# Use Case Study

In this activity you will examine several cryptocurrency and blockchain use cases, and curate a list of features
that each have. This list will be compared against later in class today.

## Instructions

* Get into a small group of 3-4
* Each group member should pick a use case to read for a few minutes
* While reading, make a list of the different features and functionality that you notice
* Compare your lists to your group
* Discuss the differences and similarities
* Try to come up with a core set of features that all of the use cases share

* Try to imagine the implications of these technologies on society
