# Peoplechain

The best way to understand how the blockchain keeps track of transactions is to emulate one!
As a class, you will be getting into groups that will each participate in the network in a different way.
This activity will demonstrate the public, borderless, and censor resistant nature of the blockchain.

## Instructions

* Get into 3 groups.

  * Group 1: Money senders

  * Group 2: Record keepers in the US

  * Group 3: Record keepers in the country of their choice

* **Moneysenders**, you are up! Once the instructor says “go” you will:

  1. Spread out over the class. You are all going to work individually to send transactions to members of the other two groups.

  2. Then, create a "transaction" by typing out an object that's formatted like this, but with your own custom values:

     * `{ to: "StudentA", from: "StudentB", amount: "$100", fee: "$1.00" }`

  3. Send the transaction to someone from Group 2 or Group 3.

* Finally, repeat steps 1-3 with different students, different amounts, and different fees!

* **Record Keepers**, you are up (both Groups 2 and 3). Once the instructor says “go”, you will:

  * Both groups should elect ONE slacker for their group. This person will not be slacking off. Instead, they will be slacking messages back and forth with the other country!

  * Group 2 Slacker: Create channel called US Record Keepers and invite your group

  * Group 3 Slacker: Create channel called [your country of choice] Record Keepers and invite your group

  * If anyone receives a transaction from the Moneysenders, copy and paste it into your personal slack (slack it to yourself). This will be your personal ledger.

  * Then, once you have slacked it to yourself, slack it to everyone else in your group.

  * The team Slacker will be responsible for sending every transaction listed in their group channel to the other team’s Slacker, who will then share it with their group channel.

* Example:

Rosa is a Moneysender. Joe is the Slacker for US Record Keepers. Alec is the Slacker for China (the other country in this example). Jeremy is a member of the US Record Keepers.

* Rosa sends a transaction to Jeremy.
* Jeremy sends a copy of the transaction to himself and to his team channel, the US Record Keepers.
* Joe sees the slack from Jeremy in the group channel and sends a copy of the transaction to Alec.
* Alec sends a copy of the transaction to his team channel, The Chinese Record Keepers.
