# Use Case Brainstorm

Now that you have learned about Ethereum, the leading decentralized world computing platform, it's time to think about different applications you might build with this new technology.

## Instructions

* Get into small groups of up to three people for discussion.

* Go to the [Enterprise Ethereum Alliance members](https://entethalliance.org/members/) page, and select a few members that pop out to you.

* Navigate to several of the links and investigate what blockchain applications are the members working on.

* Discuss with your group interesting findings:

  * What the use case is.

  * What problems that blockchain is helping to solve in this use case.

## Hint

* Some of these companies might not directly reference blockchain projects, so you'll want to focus more on the members that have started implementations versus the ones supporting research and development.
