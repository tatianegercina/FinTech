# Peoplechain

The best way to understand how the blockchain keeps track of transactions is to emulate one!

As a class, you will be getting into groups that will each participate in the network in a different way. This activity will demonstrate the public, borderless, and censor-resistant nature of blockchain.

## Instructions

Get into three groups.

* Group 1: Money Senders.

* Group 2: Record Keepers in the U.S.

* Group 3: Record Keepers in the country of their choice.

### Roles Description

#### Money Senders

You are up! Once the instructor says “go,” you will:

1. Spread out over the class. You are all going to work individually to send transactions via Slack to members of the other two groups.

2. Create a "transaction" by typing out an object that's formatted like this, but with your own custom values:

    ```python
    { to: "StudentA", from: "StudentB", amount: "$100", fee: "$1.00" }
    ```

3. Slack out the transaction to someone from Group 2 or Group 3.

Repeat steps 1 to 3 with different students, different amounts, and various fees!

#### Record Keepers

You are up (both groups 2 and 3). Once the instructor says “go,” you will:

* Both groups should elect one Slacker for their group. This person will not be slacking off. Instead, they will be slacking messages back and forth with the other country.

* If anyone receives a transaction from the Money Senders, copy and paste it into your personal Slack (slack it to yourself). This will be your personal ledger.

* Then, once you have slacked it to yourself, slack it to everyone else in your group slack channel.

* The team Slacker will be responsible for sending every transaction listed in their group channel to the other team’s Slacker, who will then share it with their group channel.

## Example

Rosa is a Money Sender. Joe is the Slacker for U.S. Record Keepers. Alec is the Slacker for China (the other country in this example). Jeremy is a member of the U.S. Record Keepers.

* Rosa sends a transaction to Jeremy.

* Jeremy sends a copy of the transaction to himself and to his team channel, the U.S. Record Keepers.

* Joe sees the Slack message from Jeremy in the group channel and sends a copy of the transaction to Alec.

* Alec sends a copy of the transaction to his team channel, the China Record Keepers.
