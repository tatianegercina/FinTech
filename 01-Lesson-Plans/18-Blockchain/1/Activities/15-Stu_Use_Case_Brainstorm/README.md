# Use case brainstorm

Now that you have learned about Ethereum, the leading decentralized world computing platform, it's time to think about
different applications you might build with this new technology.

## Instructions

* Get into small groups for discussion.

* Go to the [Enterprise Ethereum Alliance members](https://entethalliance.org/members/) page select a few that pop out to you.

* Navigate to several of the links.

* Discuss with your group intersting findings:

  * What the use case is

  * What problems that blockchain is helping to solve in this use case

## Hint

* Some of these companies might not directly reference blockchain projects, so you'll want to focus more on
  the members that have started implementations, versus the ones supporting research and development.
