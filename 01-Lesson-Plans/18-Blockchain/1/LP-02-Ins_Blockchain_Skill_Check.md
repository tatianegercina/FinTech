### 2. Instructor Do - Blockchain Skill Check (5 mins)

Welcome to the blockchain part of the course! Time to gauge which students are familiar with the technology by asking a few questions.

Begin asking simple yes or no questions and ask the students to raise their hands for yes:

* How many of you have heard of cryptocurrency before?

* How many of you have ever purchased cryptocurrency?

* How many of you have ever traded cryptocurrency?

* How many of you have heard of blockchain before?

* How many of you have ever purchased blockchain before?

The last question is loaded and everyone should have their hands down, and it may even elicit some laughs from those that get the joke.
State that blockchain is the technology that powers not just cryptocurrencies but entire decentralized economies and even enterprise networks.
Notably, JP Morgan Chase, the largest US bank, created Quorum, an Ethereum based blockchain.

Have the students reset and put their hands down, then ask the students to hold out a fist-to-five (fist for 0, 5 fingers up for 5) to answer how familiar they are with the following topics:

* How familiar are you with blockchain?

* How comfortable to you feel having a conversation about blockchain technology?

* How familiar are you with smart contracts?

At this point you should have an idea of which students have an affinity towards this technology.

Take a mental note of these students, as you will be able to distribute them among groups that have less knowledge about the topic.
