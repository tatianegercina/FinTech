## 18.1 Lesson Plan: Blockchain Building Blocks

### Overview

Today's class will introduce students to blockchain technologies. Students will learn
the fundamentals of what the technology is, the types of problems it solves, and how it works.

The goal of this lesson is to get the students thinking about how blockchain technology
is used and how it will likely effect their lives as a FinTech entrepreneur, as well
as be able to use basic tools like wallets and block explorers to navigate the space, and to hold a conversation about the topic.

### Class Objectives

By the end of the class, students be able to:

* Describe why blockchain exists.

* Explain blockchain technology and its use cases to someone that doesn't have any blockchain background

* Describe the 5 Pillars of Open Blockchains.

* Use a blockchain wallet and explain how it works to somebody who doesn't know.

* Visualize transactions via block explorers.

* Students will be able to brainstorm solutions for the those without robust financial institutions.

* Students will be able to navigate the blockchain ecosystem

### Instructor Notes

* Some students may already be involved with cryptocurrencies or other blockchain projects
  and may have some opinions already about particular blockchain implementations. Due to the niche nature of the field, they may have certain biases already.

* Ethereum has the largest developer community in the blockchain space, learning it has high skill transferability.

* Today's class will go over some very thought provoking topics, so be prepared for fruitful discussions.

* Smart Contracts = Programs that run on the Blockchain, and nothing more. You write smart contracts in Solidity, compile them,
  create the contract with a transaction on the blockchain. The contract can then be used on Ethereum.

* While blockchain inherently has a finance-heavy set of use cases, encourage students to think bigger,
  since the technology can be used for building secure, globally distributed software.

### 1. Instructor Do: Welcome (5 min)

* **Files:**

  * [slides x-y]()

Welcome to the blockchain part of the course! Introduce the students by reminding them
that they are about to embark on a new set of technologies from they have been
using.

* Remind the students that it is normal that they may feel a sense of unfamiliarity as they are charting new territories.

* Explain to students that blockchain technology is the thing that powers cryptocurrencies.

* To name a few popular ones, Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Dash, and Stellar.

* It does not only power FinTech solutions, it is being adopted in many industries like health care, IoT, supply chain tracking, and many more.

### 2. Instructor Do: Blockchain Skill Check (5 min)

Time to gauge which students are familiar with the technology by asking a few questions.
Begin asking simple yes or no questions and ask the students to raise their hands for yes:

* How many of you have heard of cryptocurrency before?

* How many of you have ever purchased cryptocurrency?

* How many of you have ever traded cryptocurrency?

* How many of you have heard of blockchain before?

* How many of you have ever purchased blockchain before?

The last question is a loaded one: everyone should have their hands down, and it may even elicit some laughs from those that get the joke.
State that blockchain is the technology that powers not just cryptocurrencies but entire decentralized economies and even enterprise networks.
Notably, JP Morgan Chase, the largest US bank, created Quorum, an Ethereum based blockchain.

Have the students reset and put their hands down, then ask the students to hold out a fist-to-five (fist for 0, 5 fingers up for 5) to answer how familiar they are with the following topics:

* How familiar are you with blockchain?

* How comfortable do you feel having a conversation about blockchain technology?

* How familiar are you with smart contracts?

At this point you should have an idea of which students have an affinity towards this technology.

Take a mental note of these students, as you will be able to distribute them among groups that have less knowledge about the topic.

### 3. Instructor Do: The Importance of Blockchain (10 min)

For this activity, the instructor will lead a formal lecture regarding what blockchain technology is and why itâ€™s important.

* **Files:**

  * [slides x-y]()

Begin the activity by navigating to the slides and asking the students what types of financial services are available to them.
Discuss common services like loans, payments, credit cards, brokerages, investing, etc. These can be commonly used consumer options or business options.

* Now ask the students to imagine if they did not have any of these facilities available to them due to poor financial infrastructure.

* Explain to the students that this is the reality that 2+ billion people in the world do not have access to a banking institution.

* Even more do not have access to stable financial services.

* Things as simple as getting a business loan are near impossible in many countries today.

Explain that blockchain technology has the potential, and is currently solving these global problems today.

Blockchain technology is not only helping those without strong financial institutions, but it is solving financial bottlenecks we've been facing for decades.

* Explain that blockchain technology is being adopted by top companies such as IBM and JPM Chase for solving infrastructure issues such as:

  * Finality and transaction settlement

  * Supply chain tracking and logistics

  * Tokenization of securities and new financial markets

  * Notarization and multi-party agreement verification

Ask the students, what happens when you send money to someone via PayPal? Venmo? Cashapp? Walk them through the steps:

* The money goes from your bank, to PayPal, then to the final bank before it hits the other person's account balance.

* How many fees are being created throughout this process? What is a notable characteristic of this model?

* Explain how in this model, there are many middlemen that sit between you and the recipient of the money.

* Drive home the point that in a blockchain model, the transaction simply goes from account A to account B, with no middlemen institutions.

* This allows for much faster settlement, and a much better experience for the consumer.

Now ask the students, what were to happen if you lived in a country where your human rights were not respected?

What type of financial system would you choose in this case?

### 4. Students Do: Use Case Study (10 min)

Students will complete a thought experiment in which the students will get together in small groups and examine an example use case application
for different cryptocurrency and blockchain projects.

The goal is to have the students write down the features they gleam from the different use cases.
This list will be compared against the 5 Pillars of Open blockchains in a following lecture.

Circulate through the room while students are completing the activity. Look to identify students who are actively engaging peers and digging deeper.
Keep these students in mind for later as they may be helpful to distribute among groups.

**Instructions:**

* [README.md](Activities/04-Stu_Use_Case_Study/README.md)

### 5. Instructor Do: Use Case Study Review (5 min)

Discuss with the class which features they noticed.

Have groups share a few items on the lists of features they curated.

Some common features may be:

* Transparency

* Privacy (in the case of Monero)

* Smart contracts

* Neutrality

* Hedge against hyperinflated currencies

* Bridge of trust between parties that might not trust each other

* Cross-border nature

* Pseudonymous system (addresses are your alias, not necessarily attached to identity)

### 6. Instructor Do: The 5 Pillars of Open Blockchains (10 min)

For this activity, the instructor will lead a formal lecture regarding what the 5 pillars of open blockchains are and why they are relevant.

* **Files:**

  * [slides x-y]()

Begin the activity by reminding the students to keep the use cases they just examined in mind, as well as comparing the features they wrote down.

Then, transition through the slides and begin talking about each topic.

Begin by prefacing that each of these pillars ties into each other to build an open blockchain network.

![screenshot of open slide](https://image.shutterstock.com/image-photo/open-blue-door-sunshine-600w-624832211.jpg)

* Openness in this context refers to access:

  * Anyone can access the source code and create a project from it, therefore developer access is high.

  * Anyone can access the chain and participate in the ecosystem.

  * Anyone can access the services the blockchain offers.

* Openness means that the system is designed to incentivize users to keep it open. The internet is an example of this,
  it is built on open protocols that anyone can learn and contribute to.

![screenshot of borderless](https://image.shutterstock.com/image-photo/abstract-science-global-network-connection-600w-1147048595.jpg)

* Explain to the students that borderless means exactly that, a network without geographical or political borders.

* To be borderless, the network needs to be decentralized. This means that the control of the network is not held by
  any central party.

* Since the blockchain is synchronized onto every device that helps maintain it (called nodes), it lives everywhere.

Ask the students: "Are you moving money across a border when you bring a credit card across customs?"

  * **Answer**: No

Ask: "In that case, are you moving money across a border when you load cryptocurrency onto your phone and travel internationally?"

  * **Answer**: Nope, you only have to register cash over 10k

Elaborate and bring out this analogy:

  * Much like the money is not on the card itself, a crypto wallet does not hold the crypto itself, just the access.

  * The blockchain is already synchronized to a device in the country you are traveling to, so accessing it is the same
  as if you were to swipe a Visa card internationally, only without Visa getting involved.

* You can also use a satellite connection to connect to blockchain networks and broadcast transactions, therefore it is truly global.

![screenshot of neutral](https://image.shutterstock.com/image-illustration/net-neutrality-abstract-background-260nw-1049711261.jpg)

* Explain how neutral means that the protocol does not discriminate against any user.
  In fact, users don't even need to be human. The blockchain does not care if you are a human or a washing machine.

* The blockchain is agnostic to the users, regardless of political or social status, or geographic location.
  A wealthy banker or government leader use the protocol in the exact same way anyone else would.

* Reinforce that while this idea sounds radical at first, it is the way the world worked up until the mid 1990s.
  This is also how cash, and many peer to peer payments work today.

* Open blockchain networks are also governed in a neutral fashion, with many using the blockchain itself for voting on the next network upgrades.

![screenshot of censor resistant](https://image.shutterstock.com/image-illustration/closeup-surprised-desperate-looking-man-600w-1399238933.jpg)

* Blockchains that are properly decentralized are highly resistant to censorship and authoritarian control.

* This means that people suffering in nations that have high censorship can still find a way to use these systems to reach out and to bypass the oppression.

* Blockchain is being used currently around the world to avoid censorship or hyperinflation in many countries such as Venezuela, Zimbabwe, China, and Russia.

* It has been said that blockchain and crypto can be seen as an insurance policy against an Orwellian future.

* Money is often compared to a form of speech. These are systems where this form of expression cannot be censored.

![screenshot of public](https://image.shutterstock.com/image-illustration/two-way-street-signs-words-260nw-156089513.jpg)

* Explain that this means that open blockchains are separate from the state. Public blockchain networks are suited for public affairs.

* Military or government work, or certain logistic implementations will likely be suited to a private network due to the confidential nature.
  This is at least until zero-knowledge proof technology that allow for total privacy on an public blockchain is further developed to scale.

* This separation of state and money is a first in history, and is similar to the separation of church and state to allow for religious freedom,
  only this allows for monetary freedom.

* Explain how these systems are built by the people, for the people, and are governed by the people.

Ask the students to compare the 5 Pillars to the features that they had written down during their use case analysis and to compare and contrast what they came up with to what they just learned.

### 7. Student Do: Peoplechain (15 min)

For this activity, students will emulate the public, censor resistant and borderless nature of the blockchain by creating
a distributed ledger like system breaking up into groups and using themselves as network participants.

Have TAs circulate to provide assistance to students facing challenges or to clarify the role of each student.

You will need to group students into at least 3 groups:

* 1 group will create and send transactions

* 1 group will be a geographical region of "nodes"

* 1 group will be a second geographical region of "nodes"

Have the students pick which part of the world their group will be in.

**Instructions:**

* [README.md](Activities/07-Stu_Peoplechain/README.md)

### 8. Instructor Do: Peoplechain Review (5 min)

Ask the students a few questions about the activity:

  * If one person lied about a transaction, would it be easy to tell?

    * **Answer**: Sure, you could double check with another ledger.

    * **Answer**: In reality, there are cryptographic features that will also prevent this.

  * What would you do if you discovered a ledger keeper was lying, or not responding?

    * **Answer** Take note and stop communicating with them.

    * **Answer** You might even tell others that they lied.

  * What are the ways this system is making lying harder to do?

    * **Answer** Since the ledger is everywhere, and transactions are broadcasted to everyone, it is difficult to lie.

Ask the students to ponder the following (no answer required):

  * While it may be easy to discover one node is lying, what if one entire region had a different copy of the ledger?

    * **Answer** You would have a consensus problem.

### 9. Student Do: Basic Terminology (10 min)

For this activity, students will Google common terminology used in blockchain development.

Have the TAs circulate through the class and clarify definitions for students that are confused.

**Instructions:**

* [README.md](Activities/09-Stu_Basic_Terminology/README.md)

### 10. Instructor Do: Basic Terminology Review (10 min)

Students will learn basic, common terminology that will enable them to navigate the blockchain space.

* **Files:**

  * [slides x-y]()

Navigate to the slides and define common terms:

![screenshot of hash](https://image.shutterstock.com/image-photo/man-turning-cryptography-switch-change-600w-1038745234.jpg)

* Explain that a "hash" is a unique fingerprint of a piece of data.

* A hash function is one-way, which means that you cannot reverse a hash much like you can't reverse mixing paint.

* There are several popular hashing algorithms, SHA256 being one of the most popular.

* However, it is easy to run the hash function over the same data again to verify the result is the same.

* If you were to change a single bit of the input, you would get a completely different hash.
  This allows for something called "data integrity" which is a very important part of internet and data security as well as blockchain technology.

![screenshot of signature](https://image.shutterstock.com/image-vector/businessman-hands-signing-digital-signature-600w-351292748.jpg)

* Digital signatures are used to mathematically prove ownership or authenticity of data.
  Once a file or message is signed, you can verify it was signed by a specific individual.

* If the signed message is modified, the signature will be invalidated.

* This means that if you were to sign a document, and the document was later modified, the signature would invalidate.
  You could then easily prove that the document was modified. This is not just used for documents, but secure internet communication as well.

* Ask the students "If a signed message is modified, what happens?"

  * **Answer** The message will be invalidated and you would know the message was modified

![screenshot of wallet](https://image.shutterstock.com/image-illustration/digital-wallet-concept-3d-rendering-600w-487340401.jpg)

* A digital wallet is simply a set of "keys" to your funds that are on the blockchain.

* This means that with a wallet, you can create and send transactions, as well as view your balance.

* You can also sign messages with your digital wallet to prove ownership or authenticity of something.

* A digital wallet is much like the debit cards in your own wallet, you use them to access funds in your account.
  Only in this case, the card is now a key, and the bank is now the blockchain.

![screenshot of transaction](https://image.shutterstock.com/image-photo/finger-pressing-block-chain-text-600w-1026226699.jpg)

* "So what's a transaction then?"

* Explain that a transaction is simply a signed message that authorizes a movement of funds between two parties.

* It is essentially "I sign off on the movement of X amount of value from account A to account B" -- now that it is signed off, nobody can modify it.

![screenshot of node](https://image.shutterstock.com/image-vector/abstract-scheme-modern-computer-network-600w-155306969.jpg)

* A full node keeps a copy of the blockchain. It verifies every transactions signatures and throws out any that do not validate.

* If you wanted to send a transaction, you would send it to a node to keep track of. Nodes broadcast the transaction to
  their neighbors, until a miner comes along and finalizes the transactions.

* Nodes are enforcing **all** of the rules of the blockchain, thus they are a very important part of the security of the network.

![screenshot of miner](https://image.shutterstock.com/image-illustration/design-element-3d-illustration-rendering-600w-1167357031.jpg)

* A miner/block producer is a special type of node that is working to solve computations in order to finalize transactions.

* Miners take the pending transactions from the nodes they are connected to and put them into a block.

* Each miner races against each other to perform this process first, and the winner is rewarded by the network for its work.
  Then this race happens again and again for each new block in the chain.

Reassure the students that we will dive deeper into the mechanisms in which nodes and miners communicate with each other,
as well as the full lifecycle of a transaction from creation to being stored in a block.

### 11. Student Do: Using a Wallet (10 min)

For this activity, students will be testing a cryptocurrency wallet.

Have the TAs circulate through the class and ensure that students are able to send and receive transactions.

**Instructions:**

* [README.md](Activities/10-Stu_Using_Wallet/README.md)

### 12. Instructor Do: Using a Wallet Review (5 min)

Ask the students: "What types of things stood out to you?"

  * **Answer**: You can pick your own fees

  * **Answer**: You can view the status of the transactions live

Let the students know that there are many types of wallets. We just used a desktop wallet,
but the students will be building one next unit.

Ask if any students noticed the "data" field, and what it might be.

  * Explain that this field is where contract calls or arbitrary strings can be stored within the transaction.

### 13. Instructor Do: Block Explorers Demo (10 minutes)

The goal of this demo is to show the students how block explorers can be used to visualize transactions on the blockchain.

Open [this link](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0xc3879b456daa348a16b6524cbc558d2cc984722c) to the Ropsten Etherscan block explorer.

This has an address pre-populated, but it is recommended to use an account that you own and have made the transactions personally.

* Point out the balance field. Reflect that this is part of the public nature of blockchains, and some blockchains have this field hidden.

![balance](Images/balance.png)

* Scroll through the list of transactions that this account has made. Ask the students if any of these fields stand out in particular, and why?

* Point out the "Transaction Hash" column on the very left.

* Click on a transaction hash for any of the transactions.

![tx hash](Images/txhash.png)

* Ask the students what they think a transaction hash might be, and what it might be used for.

  * **Answer**: The transaction hash is used as the unique ID of the transaction to find it later.

* Go back to the initial address page, then click on the "block number" section of a transaction

![block number](Images/blocknumber.png)

* Point out the fields "Mined By" and "Block Reward" and explain that this is the address of the miner that successfully created this block
  and received that amount of Ether as reward.

![miner](Images/miner.png)

* Click on the "Transactions" button to view which transactions were mined in that block.

![transactions](Images/transactions.png)

* Explain that these are the transactions that were mined in this particular block:

![block](Images/block.png)

Have a student volunteer to send out the transaction hash of a recent transcation made to a fellow student.

Walk through the student's recent transactions and point out the "from", "to", and "amount" fields and verify this with the students that these transactions ocurred between.

Ask the students to point out any fields that may confuse them or that they are curious about.
If they point out the following terms, reassure them that they will be explained in greater detail later:

* Difficulty

* Gas

* Gas Limit

* Nonce

### 14. Student Do: Visualizing Transactions (10 min)

For this activity, students will visualize transactions using the same technique used in the demo.

Students will get into small groups and will explore the blockchain using Etherscan together.

Have TAs circulate to provide assistance to students facing challenges or to clarify the role of each student.

**Instructions:**

* [README.md](Activities/14-Stu_Visualizing_Transactions/README.md)

### 15. Instructor Do: Visualizing Transactions Review (5 min)

Review the groups and ensure that students can navigate and visualize transactions.

Recap by asking the students to answer these questions:

* "What is a transaction hash?"

* "What type of information is available to you on a public blockchain's block explorer?"

  **Answer** Practically everything, balances, transaction history, data stored on chain, etc.

* "Is this a fully anonymous blockchain?"

  **Answer** No, the current version of the public Ethereum network is pseudonymous, not fully anonymous yet.

Explain to the class that while the current version of Ethereum is pseudonymous, future updates will bring a technology
called "Zero Knowledge Proofs" that will enable completely private transactions on a public network.
This means that the balances and transaction history between accounts will be encrypted in a way that allows
for verification without exposing potentially sensitive information.

This means that in the future, transactions will be private, and you will only be able to view transactions that you are a part of.
There are currently public blockchains like Zcash that implement this now by default, so be on the look out for zero knowledge protocols
in future blockchain upgrades.

### 16. BREAK (15 min)

- - -

### 17. Instructor Do: Intro to Ethereum (10 min)

* **Files:**

  * [slides x-y]()

Walk through the slides and highlight the following:

* Ask the students: "What would it be like to have money built into your programming language, as a first data type like string or number?"
  This is what Ethereum brings to the table.

* Ethereum secures over $20 billion in assets without a central authority. It powers a huge ecosystem of decentralized applications
  and financial ecosystems.

* First generation blockchains were much like the days of carrying a cell phone, iPod, and calculator with you. Each solved a specific problem.
  Ethereum brought to blockchains what the iPhone brought to personal computing, a general purpose platform where apps take the place of separate devices.
  Now, you can build fully fledged applications on top of the blockchain with Ethereum.

* You can think of Ethereum like the inverse of AWS Lambda. With Lambda, you upload your code to Amazon and pay per use.
  Amazon in this case is the central party, they control the computing. Whereas in Ethereum, every person who helps run Ethereum
  becomes part of the "global computer" and you pay the network itself to run your code instead of a single party.

* Ask the students: "What are some benefits you can think of to having compute power distributed in such a way?"

  **Answer** No bottlenecks in the system, since the world helps run the code

  **Answer** Highly reliable systems that will run regardless of if some servers go down

If students are unclear as to how this works, reassure them that they will be learning the inner workings when they begin Smart Contracts.
The biggest point to get across is that everyone shares computing power in order to create a platform that anyone can upload and run code on top of.

* Tokenization is one of the leading use cases of the platform, allowing for things like stablecoins, utility tokens, security tokens,
  or for representing unique digital or physical assets.

Now, transition to talk about the types of financial services that you can build with Ethereum:

* Payments - Peer to Peer, Business to Business, Business to Customer, Machine to Machine

* Remittances â€“ Movement of funds across borders into a bank account.

* Loans â€“ Using crypto-currency as collateral for loans to reduce costs of transactions.

* Deposit taking â€“ Storing crypto in wallets to use as interest earning assets.

* Notary services â€“ Blockchain based notary services that authenticates documents.

* Brokerage services â€“ Trading tokens and other digital assets on the Blockchain.

* Foreign exchange â€“ Using crypto as a bridge between fiat currencies to reduce the cost of foreign currency fees.

* Decentralized crypto exchange - Using the blockchain as a backend to support a crypto-trading exchange.

### 18. Student Do: Use Case Brainstorm (15 min)

Now that the students have learned about the features of Ethereum and how it acts as a decentralized world computer,
it is a good time to brainstorm different use cases given these features.

Students will get into groups and come up with different decentralized application ideas, as well as discuss dapps
they may be familiar with.

Have TAs circulate throughout the class, facilitating discussion and ensuring students are not lost.

**Instructions:**

* [README.md](Activities/15-Stu_Use_Case_Brainstorm/README.md)

### 19. Instructor Do: Use Case Review (10 min)

Ask different groups what their most interesting use case was and have them describe them to the class.

Facilitate the discussion toward the benefits of decentralizing certain applications.

* What are the main benefits of decentralizing your application?

  **Answer** The application can only go down if the entire Ethereum network goes down.

  **Answer** The application can run without a central server.

  **Answer** The application could potentially live forever (as long as Ethereum exists).

  **Answer** The application is pay-per-use, much like a decentralized AWS Lambda.

* If the students chose a game-based use case, ask what type of assets they have represented?

* Is there a limit to what you can build with Ethereum's Turing complete smart contracts?

  **Answer** No, in theory, you could build any application just as you would with any other general purpose programming language.

Reinforce the idea that Ethereum's smart contracts are just programs that run on a distributed, decentralized computer.
Anyone can upload and pay to run code in a secure sandboxed compute environment, allowing for a more secure, immutable web,
and for building powerful financial applications.

### 20. Instructor Do: Recap (5 min)

Students have learned tons of new information today. Facilitate a discussion around the different ideas that were spoken about during
the class, and what questions students may be asking the most.

* What types of blockchain applications excite you the most?

* What types of financial services can blockchains improve?

  **Answer** Practically any that currently requires unnecessary middlemen

* How does blockchain technology improve the lives of people around the world?

  **Answer** It provides robust financial platforms that don't always exist, or are not trustworthy.

  **Answer** It supports borderless, neutral, and censor resistant finance that cannot be oppressed easily.
