### 3. Instructor Do - The 5 Pillars of Open Blockchains (10 mins)

For this activity, the instructor will lead a formal lecture regarding what the 5 pillars of open blockchains are and why they are relevant.

**Files**

* [slides x-y]()

Begin the activity by reminding the students to keep the use cases they just examined in mind, as well as comparing the features they wrote down.

Then, transition through the slides and begin talking about each topic.

Begin by prefacing that each of these pillars ties into each other to build an open blockchain network.

* Openness in this context refers to access:

  * Anyone can access the source code and create a project from it, therefore developer access is high.

  * Anyone can access the chain and participate in the ecosystem.

  * Anyone can access the services the blockchain offers.

* Openness means that the system is designed to incentivize users to keep it open. The internet is an example of this,
  it is built on open protocols that anyone can learn and contribute to.

* Explain to the students that borderless means exactly that, a network without geographical or political borders.

* To be borderless, the network needs to be decentralized. This means that the control of the network is not held by
  any central party.

* Since the blockchain is synchronized onto every device that helps maintain it (called nodes), it lives everywhere.

Ask the students: "Are you moving money across a border when you bring a credit card across customs?"

  * **Answer**: No

Ask: "In that case, are you moving money across a border when you load cryptocurrency onto your phone and travel internationally?"

  * **Answer**: Nope, you only have to register cash over 10k

Elaborate and bring out this analogy:

  * Much like the money is not on the card itself, a crypto wallet does not hold the crypto itself, just the access.

  * The blockchain is already synchronized to a device in the country you are traveling to, so accessing it is the same
  as if you were to swipe a Visa card internationally, only without Visa getting involved.

* You can also use a satellite connection to connect to blockchain networks and broadcast transactions, therefore it is truly global.

* Explain how neutral means that the protocol does not discriminate against any user.
  In fact, users don't even need to be human. The blockchain does not care if you are a human or a washing machine.

* The blockchain is agnostic to the users, regardless of political or social status, or geographic location.
  A wealthy banker or government leader use the protocol in the exact same way anyone else would.

* Reinforce that while this idea sounds radical at first, it is the way the world worked up until the mid 1990s.
  This is also how cash, and many peer to peer payments work today.

* Open blockchain networks are also governed in a neutral fashion, with many using the blockchain itself for voting on the next network upgrades.

[screenshot of censor resistant](Images/censorresistant.png)

* Blockchains that are properly decentralized are highly resistant to censorship and authoritarian control.

* This means that people suffering in nations that have high censorship can still find a way to use these systems to reach out and to bypass the oppression.

* Blockchain is being used currently around the world to avoid censorship or hyperinflation in many countries such as Venezuela, Zimbabwe, China, and Russia.

* It has been said that blockchain and crypto can be seen as an insurance policy against an Orwellian future.

* Money is often compared to a form of speech. These are systems where this form of expression cannot be censored.

[screenshot of public](Images/public.png)

* Explain that this means that open blockchains are separate from the state. Public blockchain networks are suited for public affairs.

* Military or government work, or certain logistic implementations will likely be suited to a private network due to the confidential nature.
  This is at least until zero-knowledge proof technology that allow for total privacy on an public blockchain is further developed to scale.

* This separation of state and money is a first in history, and is similar to the separation of church and state to allow for religious freedom,
  only this allows for monetary freedom.

* Explain how these systems are built by the people, for the people, and are governed by the people.

Ask the students to compare the 5 Pillars to the features that they had written down during their use case analysis and to compare and contrast what they came up with to what they just learned.
