### 3. Instructor Do - The 5 Pillars of Open Blockchains (10 mins)

For this activity, the instructor will lead a formal lecture regarding what the 5 pillars of open blockchains are and why they are relevant.

**Files**

* Slides

Begin the activity by reminding the students to keep the use cases they just examined in mind, as well as comparing the features they wrote down.

Then, transition through the slides and begin talking about each topic.

Begin by prefacing that each of these pillars ties into each other to build an open blockchain network.

#### Open

* Explain to the students that openness in this context refers to access:
  * Anyone can access the source code and create a project from it, therefore developer access is high.
  * Anyone can access the chain and participate in the ecosystem.
  * Anyone can access the services the blockchain offers.

* Open doesn't just mean open, but un-closeable, meaning that once permissionlessness is implemented, it is near impossible to revert.

#### Borderless

* Explain to the students that borderless means exactly that, a network without geographical or political borders.

* Borderless also means decentralized. This is a critical goal for an open blockchain.

* Since the blockchain is synchronized across every full node that participates, it lives everywhere.

* Ask: Are you moving money across a border when you bring a credit card across customs?
  * **Answer**: No

* Ask: In that case, are you moving money across a border when you load cryptocurrency onto your phone and travel internationally?

* Elaborate and bring out this analogy:
  * The money is not on the card itself right? The card is simply access to your money, and the money is in a bank.
  * The cryptowallet is the same, the blockchain is the bank and your private key is your access to it.
  * Reinforce that in this case, the blockchain is already at the country of travel synchronized somewhere nearby, much like your bank could be international.

* You can also use a satellite connection to connect to blockchain networks and broadcast transactions, therefore it is truly global.

#### Neutral

* Explain how neutral means that the protocol does not discriminate against any user.
  In fact, users don't even need to be human. The blockchain does not care if you are a human or a washing machine.

* The blockchain is agnostic to the users, regardless of political or social status, or geographic location.
  A wealthy banker or government leader use the protocol in the exact same way anyone else would.

* Reinforce that while this idea sounds radical at first, it is the way the world worked up until the mid 1990s

* Explain that neutral also means in governance in the system.
  Open blockchain networks are governed in a neutral fashion, with many using the blockchain itself for voting and governance.

#### Censorship Resistant

* This is a core principal of open blockchain networks. Explain that the idea is that open blockchains that are properly decentralized are highly resistant
  to censorship and authoritarian control. Couple this with the borderless and neutral nature of the system, the robustness and immutability is dramatic.

* This means that people suffering in nations that have high censorship can still find a way to use these systems to reach out and to bypass the oppression.

* Blockchain is being used currently around the world to avoid censorship or hyperinflation in many countries such as Venezuela, Zimbabwe, China, and Russia.

* This calls to the nature of using cryptography to avoid censorship and to increase freedoms for individuals and to resist authoritarianism.
  It has been said that blockchain and crypto can be seen as an insurance policy against an Orwellian future.

* Money is often compared to a form of speech. These are systems where this form of expression cannot be censored.

#### Public

* Explain that this means that open blockchains are separate from the state. Public blockchain networks are suited for public affairs.

* Military or government work, or certain logistic implementations will likely be suited to a private network due to the confidential nature.
  This is at least until zero-knowledge proof technology that allow for total privacy on an public blockchain is further developed to scale.

* This separation of state and money is a first in history, and is similar to the separation of church and state to allow for religious freedom,
  only this allows for monetary freedom.

* Explain how these systems are built by the people, for the people, and are governed by the people.

Ask the students to compare the 5 Pillars to the features that they had written down during their use case analysis and to compare and contrast
what they came up with to the pillars.
