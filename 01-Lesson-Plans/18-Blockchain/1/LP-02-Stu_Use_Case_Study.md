### 16. Students Do: Use Case Study (10 mins)

Students will complete a thought experiment in which the students will get together in small groups and examine an example use case application
for different cryptocurrency and blockchain projects.

The goal is to have the students write down the features they gleam from the different use cases.
This list will be compared against the 5 Pillars of Open blockchains in a following lecture.

Circulate through the room while students are completing the activity. Look to identify students who are actively engaging peers and digging deeper.
Keep these students in mind for later as they may be helpful to distribute among groups.
