Begin the activity by navigating to the slides and asking the students what types of financial services are available to them.
Discuss common services like loans, payments, credit cards, brokerages, investing, etc. These can be commonly used consumer options or business options.

* Now ask the students to imagine if they did not have any of these facilities available to them due to poor financial infrastructure.

* Explain to the students that this is the reality that 2+ billion people in the world do not have access to a banking institution.

* Even more do not have access to stable financial services.

* Things as simple as getting a business loan are near impossible in many countries today.

Explain that blockchain technology has the potential, and is currently solving these global problems today.

Blockchain technology is not only helping those without strong financial institutions, but it is solving financial bottlenecks we've been facing for decades.

* Explain that blockchain technology is being adopted by top companies such as IBM and JPM Chase for solving infrastructure issues such as:

  * Finality and transaction settlement

  * Supply chain tracking and logistics

  * Tokenization of securities and new financial markets

  * Notarization and multi-party agreement verification

Ask the students, what happens when you send money to someone via PayPal? Venmo? Cashapp? Walk them through the steps:

* The money goes from your bank, to PayPal, then to the final bank before it hits the other person's account balance.

* How many fees are being created throughout this process? What is a notable characteristic of this model?

* Explain how in this model, there are many middlemen that sit between you and the recipient of the money.

* Drive home the point that in a blockchain model, the transaction simply goes from account A to account B, with no middlemen institutions.

* This allows for much faster settlement, and a much better experience for the consumer.

Now ask the students, what were to happen if you lived in a country where your human rights were not respected?

What type of financial system would you choose in this case?
