### 14. Instructor Do: Intro to Ethereum (10 mins)

**Files:**

* [slides x-y]()

Walk through the slides and highlight the following:

* Ask the students: "What would it be like to have money built into your programming language, as a first data type like string or number?"
  This is what Ethereum brings to the table.

* Ethereum secures over $20 billion in assets without a central authority. It powers a huge ecosystem of decentralized applications
  and financial ecosystems.

* Many companies are leveraging Ethereum today, including JP Morgan Chase, IBM, Consensys, and many more, forming the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance.
  This means that by learning Ethereum, you will be gaining valuable blockchain skills that you can take practically anywhere.

* Ethereum was created in 2015 and has become the largest decentralized computing platform, ever. All of this was funded via global crowdsale.
  This means it was built by the world, for the world.

* First generation blockchains were much like the days of carrying a cell phone, iPod, and calculator with you. Each solved a specific problem.
  Ethereum brought to blockchains what the iPhone brought to personal computing, a general purpose platform where apps take the place of separate devices.
  Now, you can build fully fledged applications on top of the blockchain with Ethereum.

* You can think of Ethereum like the inverse of AWS Lambda. With Lambda, you upload your code to Amazon and pay per use.
  Amazon in this case is the central party, they control the computing. Whereas in Ethereum, every person who helps run Ethereum
  becomes part of the "global computer" and you pay the network itself to run your code instead of a single party.

* Ask the students: "What are some benefits you can think of to having compute power distributed in such a way?"

  **Answer** No bottlenecks in the system, since the world helps run the code

  **Answer** Highly reliable systems that will run regardless of if some servers go down

If students are unclear as to how this works, reassure them that they will be learning the inner workings when they begin Smart Contracts.
The biggest point to get across is that everyone shares computing power in order to create a platform that anyone can upload and run code on top of.

* Tokenization is one of the leading use cases of the platform, allowing for things like stablecoins, utility tokens, security tokens,
  or for representing unique digital or physical assets.

Now, transition to talk about the types of financial services that you can build with Ethereum:

* Payments - Peer to Peer, Business to Business, Business to Customer, Machine to Machine

* Remittances – Movement of funds across borders into a bank account.

* Loans – Using crypto-currency as collateral for loans to reduce costs of transactions.

* Deposit taking – Storing crypto in wallets to use as interest earning assets.

* Notary services – Blockchain based notary services that authenticates documents.

* Brokerage services – Trading tokens and other digital assets on the Blockchain.

* Foreign exchange – Using crypto as a bridge between fiat currencies to reduce the cost of foreign currency fees.

* Decentralized crypto exchange - Using the blockchain as a backend to support a crypto-trading exchange.
