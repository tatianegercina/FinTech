# Hashing with Hashlib

In this activity, you will be hashing some strings with `hashlib`. You'll be using the `sha256` algorithm, a very popular choice that is known to be secure.

## Instructions

Using the [starter file](Unsolved/hashing.py), complete the following steps:

1. Fill in the two messages with the **same** string.

2. Print both messages and their corresponding hashes.

3. Compare the two hashes in an `if/else` statement. The output should be `True` since they are the same message.

4. Compare the length of the hashes. What do you notice?

5. Modify one of the messages, then rerun your program. Do the hashes still match?
