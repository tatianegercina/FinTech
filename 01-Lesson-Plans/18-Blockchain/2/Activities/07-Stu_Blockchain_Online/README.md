# Build a Blockchain Online

In this activity, you will be building a blockchain with fundamental data structures and cryptography you've just learned.

## Instructions

* Navigate to the [Anders Blockchain Demo](https://anders.com/blockchain/blockchain).

* Type some data into a block:

* Notice that the chain is now "broken" from that point onward.

* Click `Mine` on the block you modified. This should regenerate the block's hashes and allow you to move on.

* Mine the rest of the chain to rebuild it.

* Now, modify a block that is further in the chain, like block 3.

* Answer some questions to yourself:

  * Do you have to mine the chain before block 3 again?

  * What happens if you were to mine block 5, then 4? Try it out.
