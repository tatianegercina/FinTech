# Encrypting and Decrypting Messages with Asymmetric Encryption

In this activity, you'll be sending encrypted messages the real way, by using public key (asymmetric) cryptography!

## Instructions

Get together with a partner, you will be sending messages with and do the following:

* Navigate to the ["Box" feature](https://tweetnacl.js.org/#/box) of the TweetNaCl.js demo.

* Generate a keypair by clicking `Random` in the `My Secret Key` field:

* Send your public key to your partner.

* When you receive your partner's public key, paste it into the `Their Public Key` field.

* Generate a `Nonce` to go with the message you'll send.

* Type a message into the `Message` field to encrypt.

* Once you have all of the fields filled out, you can click `Encrypt`.

* Send the following information in the message to your partner:

 * Encrypted Message from the `Box` field.

 * Nonce.

* Now, without clearing out your secret key, try to decrypt their message by pasting their encrypted message and nonce into the corresponding fields in your browser.

Congrats! You have successfully communicated securely using real asymmetric encryption!

Think to yourself and discuss with your partner:

* What is the main benefit of using this over symmetric encryption?

* What makes this safer than symmetric encryption for communications?
