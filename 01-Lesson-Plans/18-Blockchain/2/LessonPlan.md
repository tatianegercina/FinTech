### Instructor Notes

* **Important Note:** For this week's activities, Windows users **MUST** use `git-bash` and not the default command prompt in Windows!

* Today is a heavy cryptography day, it is advisable to refresh on symmetric vs. asymmetric (public key) cryptography, as well as digital signatures.

* If students are having trouble connecting with the real-world examples, they will likely have a better understanding when sending encrypted messages to each other.

* Though these cryptographic algorithms and techniques are founded on mathematics, it is not required to understand the algorithms themselves to learn how they generally operate.

* Today's lesson is not designed to teach someone how the math and algorithms work, the goal is to allow students to be able to navigate the blockchain industry and to understand basic security.

* Slack out the [Blockchain TX Installation Guide](../../19-Blockchain-Python/Supplemental/Blockchain_TX_Install_Guide.md) and the [HD Wallet Derive Installation Guide](../../19-Blockchain-Python/Supplemental/HD_Wallet_Derive_Install_Guide.md). Tell students to complete the installation and verify it with a TA before the end of the next class. Students will need this installed before the next unit.

### 1. Instructor Do: Welcome to Class (5 min)

Begin class by opening the slides and welcoming students to the cryptography fundamentals part of the course. In today's class, you will be covering the basic cryptographic techniques that blockchain technology, as well as the rest of the internet, is built upon.

Continue through the slides, asking the students to refresh their definitions:

* What is a hash?

  **Answer:** A one-way function that produces a digital fingerprint of data.

* What is a wallet?

  **Answer:** A set of "keys" to your funds that are on the blockchain.

Explain that today, we will be learning the techniques that make these things possible.

Ask the students to raise their hand if they have heard of and can define:

* Encryption

  **Answer:** It's a method that transforms information into a secret code that hides the information's true meaning.

* Digital Signatures

  **Answer:** Digital signatures are used to prove ownership or authenticity of data mathematically.

Ask the students to raise their hand if:

* They have ever used a password to protect something like their cell phone, computer, social media, etc.

* They have ever used an encrypted messaging service.

Point out that students may have seen cryptography in action when browsing the internet over HTTPS by pointing out the "green lock" in the URL bar of their web browsers.

![green lock https](Images/green-lock-https.png)

* This means the communication between you and the website is "encrypted" so that nobody else on the network can see the information.

Answer any questions before moving on.

### 2. Students Do: Cryptography Use Cases (10 min)

In this activity, students will be researching in groups some applications of cryptography in the wild.

Explain to students that getting good at this type of research is key to succeeding in an emerging field like the blockchain industry.

Have TAs circulate the class and ensure students are not stuck. This should be a generally easy-going activity.

**Files:**

* [README.md](Activities/01-Stu_Cryptography_Use_Cases/README.md)

---

### 3. Instructor Do: Cryptography Use Cases Review (10 min)

Given the research the students just did, in this activity, you will conduct a facilitated discussion to allow students to share their insights.

Referring to the slides, start the activity by asking the students to share their definitions of the following terms:

* Cryptography

  **Answer**: Using math to keep data secure.

* Encryption

  **Answer**: Using cryptography to keep data secret.

* Digital Signatures

  **Answer**: Using cryptography to prove things stay the same.

* PGP

  **Answer**: Using cryptography to email/communicate securely.

Now, ask the students to share some ideas about where they might have used cryptography in their lives, some examples may include:

* Storing files safely.

* Securing communications.

* Verifying authenticity of data.

* Payment systems (EMV chips, online payment gateways, banking communication).

Ask the students the following questions:

* What sort of institutions would you hold to the standard of using good cryptography?

  **Answer**: Banks, exchanges, financial institutions.

  **Answer**: Messaging platforms, payment systems.

* What are some risks that could exist if an encryption algorithm is broken?

  **Answer**: A data breach could occur; private information could be exposed.

* What about a hashing algorithm?

  **Answer**: Using that algorithm for data integrity would no longer be secure since each hash is no longer unique to the data.

Now elucidate that while you expect these services to be using good cryptography, practically every application benefits from having it. By using good cryptography, a more robust and secure internet can exist.

Remind students that practically all of the hacks you hear about in the news are from misconfigured or absent cryptography, so it is crucial to integrate it throughout their lives to protect their data and identity.

Answer any questions before moving on.

### 4. Instructor Do: Hashing Demo (10 min)

In this activity, students will learn how hashing works by using several different strings and comparing the results to show that given the same input, you will output the same hash.

**Files:**

* [solution.py](Activities/02-Ins_Hashing/Solved/solution.py)

Ask a volunteer student to define hashing again:

**Answer**: A one-way function that produces a digital fingerprint of data.

Walk through the solution Python script and highlight the following:

* The [`hashlib` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html) is imported; This module is part of the Python Standard Library and contains an interface to the most popular hashing algorithms.

 ```python
 import hashlib
 ```

Explain to students that most of the hashing algorithms are compliant with the [Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Information_Processing_Standards). The United States federal government develops these standards for use in computer systems by non-military government agencies and government contractors.

* `hashlib` includes the FIPS secure hash algorithms `SHA1`, `SHA224`, `SHA256`, `SHA384`, and `SHA512`, as well as the [RSAâ€™s MD5 algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5).

* A function called `hash` is defined to create a hash from an input string using the `sha256` algorithm.

 ```python
 def hash(message):
 return hashlib.sha256(message).hexdigest()
 ```

* Notice that no matter what, the same input will give the same hash output as can be seen with `sentence_one` and `sentence_two`. It's a one to one relationship.

 ```python
 sentence_one = b"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"

 print(sentence_one, hash(sentence_one))
 # output: 7d38b5cd25a2baf85ad3bb5b9311383e671a8a142eb302b324d4a5fba8748c69

 sentence_two = b"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"

 print(sentence_two, hash(sentence_two))
 # output: 7d38b5cd25a2baf85ad3bb5b9311383e671a8a142eb302b324d4a5fba8748c69
 ```

* Also notice how different inputs will result in completely different hashes, even if only one character is changed as can be seen with `payment_message_one` and `payment_message_two`.

 ```python
 payment_message_one = b"I agree to pay Joe $90"

 print(payment_message_one, hash(payment_message))
 # output: 8784fee852b5ee466c49b331098286feebc7c0d03ebf6ba826833fac376f4607

 payment_message_two = b"I agree to pay Joe $9"

 print(payment_message_two, hash(payment_message))
 # output: eee60f2df1736fb21297cd062d81eaa6f9f95241bf38c04a4db4ff264a0bae72
 ```

Ask the students if the output of the hash looks familiar, and where they might have seen them so far:

 **Answer**: Transaction IDs.

 **Answer**: Block hashes.

Point out that addresses are actually derived from hashing as well, but are not purely hashed as they will learn later today.

Answer any questions before moving on.

---

### 5. Students Do: Hashing with Hashlib (10 min)

In this activity, students will hash two equivalent messages and compare the outputs. Then, they will modify one of the messages and compare them again.

**Files:**

* [README.md](Activities/03-Stu_Hashlib/README.md)

* [hashing.py](Activities/03-Stu_Hashlib/Unsolved/hashing.py)

Point out to the students that the strings that are being hashed require the following syntax:

```python
message = b"Message to be hashed"
```

* The `b` prefixing the string definition passes the string as a byte array, which is the required input type for hashing algorithms.

* Explain to the students that this means that hashing works on all types of data, regardless of its data type, since it operates on the actual bits themselves.

Have TAs circulate through the class to ensure that students can properly hash messages.

---

### 6. Instructor Do: Hashing with Hashlib Review (5 min)

**Files:**

* [hashing.py](Activities/03-Stu_Hashlib/Solved/hashing.py)

Referring back to the slides, ask the students the following questions:

* What do you notice about the length of the hashes?

  **Answer**: They are the same length, no matter what.

* Why might this be useful?

  **Answer**: You can verify large amounts of data with a smaller string.

* What is the biggest functionality hashing enables?

  **Answer**: Data integrity

* What is the difference between data integrity and security?

  **Answer**: Data integrity is ensuring the data stays the same; security is ensuring the data stays secret.

Reaffirm to the students that the hashes of the messages should only be equal if the messages are equal.

Answer any questions before moving on.

---

### 7. Instructor Do: Symmetric Cryptography (10 min)

In this activity, students will be introduced to the concept of symmetric cryptography.

Open the session slides, move to the "Symmetric Cryptography" section, and highlight the following:

* Symmetric cryptography means "one key" to "one lock" -- hence the "symmetry."

* If you want to share the contents of a locked box, you would also have to give away the key (or a copy).

* This is the same technique used to encrypt your hard drive or password-protect a document. It's used to protect "data at rest", aka data that is not moving across a network.

Open your browser and navigate to the [Secretbox demo](https://tweetnacl.js.org/#/secretbox) from TweetNacl.js.

* This tool demonstrates symmetric and asymmetric crypto, as well as hashing, signing, and verifying messages.

Explain to the students that this `JavaScript` library contains all of the cryptography tools we need to get our job done.

Comment to students that they shouldn't worry, they will become very familiar with these tools the more they work with blockchains.

Type an arbitrary message into the `Message` box:

![symmetric message](Images/symmetric-message.png)

Reinforce that this message is a secret, and could be some corporate or health data that needs protecting.

Generate a random symmetric key by clicking the `Random` button in the `Key` field:

![symmetric key](Images/symmetric-key.png)

Explain that this key is just like using a password that you would think of on your own.

* In this case, we're going to let the tool generate a random, secure key for us.

Generate a random nonce:

![nonce](Images/symmetric-nonce.png)

Explain to the students that a "nonce" stands for "number used once". This means that you add a bit of randomness to your data so that when you encrypt it, the result is unique.

* Without the "nonce", if you encrypt the same data with the same key, you'll get the same encrypted output every time.

* This adds to a hacker's ability to do something called ["cryptanalysis"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptanalysis) in which they analyze encrypted data to break the encryption.

* By adding randomness using "nonce", this becomes a much harder task.

Click on the "Encrypt" button to encrypt the message:

![symmetric encryption](Images/symmetric-encryption.png)

Explain that the encrypted message can now be copied securely to a safe place.

Delete the plaintext in the `Message` box, and point out that we now only have the encrypted data plus its key and nonce.

Then, click `Decrypt` again to demonstrate the process of decryption.

* Only the key, nonce, and encrypted message are needed to decrypt back to the original message. We can store the encrypted message safely and decrypt it with the key and nonce later!

Answer any questions before moving on.

---

### 8. Students Do: Encrypting and Decrypting Messages (10 min)

In this activity, students will now use the same tool to encrypt and decrypt messages with a partner.

Slack out the instructions, which include the URL to the TweetNacl.js tool.

Have the students pick a partner to send and receive encrypted messages with.

Have TAs circulate and ensure that students can use the tool properly and are successfully encrypting and decrypting each other's messages.

**Files:**

* [README.md](Activities/04-Stu_Encrypting_Decrypting/README.md)

---

### 9. Instructor Do: Symmetric Cryptography Review (10 min)

Leverage the review slide to conduct a facilitated discussion in the class by asking the students the following questions:

* What did you learn?

  **Answer**: The encryption and decryption process.

* What is the most significant security hole you see in this system?

  **Answer**: The key has to be known by both parties.

  **Answer**: It might be hard to deliver the key and nonce to the recipient securely.

* What is symmetric cryptography best used for?

  **Answer**: Storing secure data on a hard drive. This is also called "encrypting data at rest."

  **Answer**: Securing data that does not need to be transferred over the internet.

Answer any questions before moving on.

---

### 10. Instructor Do: Asymmetric Cryptography Demo (10 min)

In this activity, students will learn how asymmetric cryptography works.

Open the session slides, move to the "Asymmetric Cryptography" section, and highlight the following:

* We need a way of sharing secret data without having to share a password beforehand.

* Asymmetric cryptography doesn't just use one key like symmetric, but now it splits up the key into a "keypair" -- a public key and a private key.

* This pair of keys allows us to do some neat stuff that we'll dive into shortly.

Expose to students the following situation:

* In the context of encryption, imagine that Joe's public key is like a special lockbox that you can use to store secrets in.

* Once you close this box, it can only be opened with Joe's private key.

* Anyone can use Joe's public key to send him secret data, but only he can unlock the data with his private key.

Pick a volunteer to help assist with this demo. They will be encrypting a message using the instructor's public key.

Navigate to the ["Box" feature](https://tweetnacl.js.org/#/box) of the TweetNaCl.js site. Ask your volunteer student do the same.

Generate a `Secret Key` using the `Random` button next to the "My Secret Key" box.
Have your volunteer student do the same.

* This should generate a pair of keys, public and private:

![asymmetric keys](Images/asymmetric-keys.png)

Slack out your Public Key in the `My Public Key` field to the volunteer student.

![asymmetric public](Images/asymmetric-public.png)

Have the student paste this public key into the `Their Public Key` field.

![their-asymmetric-public](Images/their-asymmetric-public.png)

Explain that in this case, you are free to share your public key. It is what will be used to encrypt the message.

* You must **always** keep your private/secret key **safe**, and **never** ever share it!

Have the volunteer student generate a `Nonce`, then ensure that the student has the following three fields populated:

* "Their Public Key" (instructor's key).

* "Secret Key".

* "My Public Key" (student's key).

* "Nonce".

Have the volunteer student type a class-friendly message into the `Message` box, then click `Encrypt`.

Ask the student to slack out the following fields to you:

* "Public Key".

* "Nonce".

* Encrypted message (the text in the `Box` field)

![Student message](Images/student-message.png)

Once the student has done that, copy the information into the running demo on your computer.

You should have the **Student** public key in the `Their Public Key` field, the nonce in the `Nonce` field, and the encrypted message in the `Box` field.

![student's info](Images/decrypting-message.png)

Click `Decrypt` and the message should be displayed:

![decrypted](Images/asymmetric-decrypted.png)

Ask the students:

* What information was not shared during this encrypted message exchange?

  **Answer**: The private key or password to the message.

Elaborate to the students about how this technique allows for secure communication without having to share private data.

* The idea is that you encrypt the data using the recipient's **public** key.

* Then, the recipient uses their **private** key to decrypt the message.

* Only the sender and receiver can decrypt the messages between them, nobody in between, and they do not need to share a secret key beforehand.

* This is what allows for something called "end-to-end" encryption, which is what encrypted messaging platforms use.

Answer any questions before moving on.

### 11. Students Do: Asymmetric Encryption (10 min)

Students will get into groups of two people, and they will encrypt and decrypt messages between each other using asymmetric encryption instead of symmetric.

Have TAs circulate and ensure that students are successfully encrypting and decrypting each other's messages.

**Files:**

* [README.md](Activities/05-Stu_Asymmetric_Encryption/README.md)

---

### 12. Instructor Do: Asymmetric Encryption Review (5 min)

Using the review slide, conduct a facilitated discussion in the class by asking the students the following questions:

* What is the most significant benefit to using asymmetric encryption over symmetric?

  **Answer**: You do not need to share a key beforehand.

  **Answer**: Only the recipient and the sender can decrypt the payloads.

* What is the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?

  **Answer**: You have a single, private key with symmetric, versus having a pair of keys for public and private use in asymmetric.

Answer any questions before moving on.

### 13. BREAK (15 min)

---

### 14. Instructor Do: Digital Signatures (10 min)

In this activity, students will learn how asymmetric cryptography can be used in digital signatures.

Explain to students that one of the applications of asymmetric cryptography is the generation and usage of digital signatures.

Illustrate the following example to the class:

* Let's say Joe wanted to sign a legal agreement and send it to Anita, but he also wanted digital proof confirming it was the exact same agreement.

* What Joe can do is take the document and "sign" it with his private key.

* This outputs a string called a "signature" that can then be used to prove the document is still the same as when it was signed originally.

* To do this, you take the document and digital signature and check it against Joe's public key.

* If the function succeeds, then you know that the signature was actually signed by Joe and was not modified.

* In this case, Joe uses his private key to "sign" his identity, and Anita can use her public key to verify the signature came from him.

Pick another volunteer student to help assist with the following demo.

Navigate to the ["Sign" feature](https://tweetnacl.js.org/#/sign) of the TweetNaCl.js demo site and do the following:

* Have your volunteer also to navigate to the "Sign" feature of the TweetNaCl.js demo, then ask the student to click the `Verify` feature on the top left.

 ![Sign verify](Images/sign-verify.png)

* On your computer, ensure the "Sign" option is selected and click on the "Random" button to generate a `key pair`.

 ![Secret Key](Images/sign-secret-key.png)

* Explain that "secret key" and "private key" are synonymous.

* Type a message to sign. Make it something like `I authorize transferring $100 to Jane Doe` to stress the importance of the data integrity, and to modify later maliciously.

* Click `Sign` to generate the message signature.

![signed message](Images/signed-message.png)

* Slack out the following fields to the volunteer student to verify the message's signature:

  * Public Key

  * Signature
  
  * Message

* Ensure that the volunteer student is at the `Verify` section of the `Sign` feature, and ask the student to paste the public key, signature, and message into their corresponding fields.

 ![Student verify message](Images/student-verify-message.png)

* Once the volunteer student has pasted the values into the correct fields, the student should be able to click on "Verify" at the bottom of the page to check the signature against the public key.

 ![verified message](Images/verified-message.png)

* Ask the student if the message was adequately verified, and if they see a green success box.

* Navigate to the `Verify` section as well, and demonstrate the same verified message to the class. The fields should stay populated.

 ![Verify your message](Images/verify-your-message.gif)

* Click `Verify` at the top to re-enable the ability to edit the `Message` field.

 ![verify again](Images/verify-edit.gif)

* Edit the message to say something different, like increasing the dollar amount from $100 to $1000.

* Demonstrate that once you modify the message after it is signed, and click `Verify` at the bottom,
the signature fails to validate.

![verification failed](Images/verify-failed.gif)

Explain to students that digital signatures are widely used to corroborate that the content of a text remains immutable.

Answer any questions before moving on.

---

### 15. Students Do: Signing and Verifying Messages (10 min)

In this activity, students will get with a partner and sign and verify messages between each other.

Have TAs circulate through the class and ensure that students are successfully verifying messages.

**Files:**

* [README.md](Activities/06-Stu_Signing_Verifying/README.md)

---

### 16. Instructor Do: Signing and Verifying Messages Review (10 min)

Refer back to the slides, then conduct a facilitated discussion by asking the students the following questions:

* It looks like this helps a lot with data integrity. Why not just hash the message instead?

  **Answer**: This proves that the owner sent and authorized that data.

  **Answer**: This is an additional layer. This provides authenticity and authentication at the same time, aka ownership and identity.

Explain to the students that digital signatures, in combination with hashing and encryption, can be a powerful way to ensure a message is delivered securely (without other parties snooping in), and that the right message got there without modification.

Ask the students (critical):

* So what do transactions on a blockchain and digital signatures have in common?

  **Answer**: A transaction is just a signed message authorizing the transfer of funds, hence cannot be modified and can be verified

Tell the students to start thinking about the different ways you might use these cryptographic techniques in the context of blockchain and cryptocurrencies.

Answer any questions before moving on.

---

### 17. Instructor Do: Blockchain Data Structure (10 min)

Now that the students understand the fundamental cryptographic techniques that power the internet and blockchain tech, let's break down the data structure of a blockchain and why the design is so secure.

Open up the [Anders Blockchain Demo](https://anders.com/blockchain/blockchain) and walk through the different fields.

Point out the matching "chain of hashes" located inside of each block:

![matching hashes](Images/blockchain-matching-hashes.png)

* Notice how the hash of the first block is inside of the second block

* This means that the hash of the second block is dependent on the previous

Ask the students the following question:

* What were to happen if the first block was modified?

  **Answer**: The second block would be invalidated since the first block's hash changed

Continuing with the first block, type some data into the data field, like `Alice sends Bob $10`.

![blockchain data field](Images/blockchain-data.png)

Explain to the class that the change from green to red represents a break in the chain

* This means that the hash in the first block has changed since we changed the data, so we have to rebuild the chain from this point all the way to the end.

Click `Mine` in the first block to change it back to green and to regenerate the hashes:

![mining](Images/blockchain-mining.png)

* Point out that we still need to mine, or "calculate" each block going forward again, one at a time, chronologically to completely rebuild the chain.

Explain to students that we will learn more about how mining works next class, but you can think of it as rebuilding the block.

Click on `Mine` in the second and third blocks to demonstrate.

![mining gif](Images/blockchain-mining.gif)

Point out that each block is dependent on each other since the hashes are chained.

Now, it's time to have the students try it for themselves. Answer any questions before moving on.

---

### 18. Students Do: Build a Blockchain Online (10 min)

In this activity, students will be repeating the blockchain online activity at their computers.

Slack out the [Anders Blockchain Demo](https://anders.com/blockchain/blockchain) to the students.

Have the TAs circulate through the class and ensure that students are connecting blocks and rebuilding the chain.

**Instructions:**

* [README.md](Activities/07-Stu_Blockchain_Online/README.md)

---

### 19. Instructor Do: Blockchain Data Structure Review (5 min)

Review the previous activity by conducting a facilitated discussion.  Using the slides, ask students the following questions:

* How are the blocks linked together / What does the "chain" in blockchain mean?

  **Answer**: Each block is linked to the previous by putting the last block's hash inside of it.

* In a blockchain with ten blocks, if you were to modify the 3rd block, how many would you need to re-mine?

  **Answer**: 8 blocks, 3 through 10 need to be mined again

Explain that this is the feature that makes blockchain transactions so "final" -- once a block is accepted by the network, it takes an enormous amount of energy to "roll a transaction back" since each block from the point of that transaction forward must be mined *again*, which quickly becomes mathematically infeasible.

Answer any questions before moving on.

---

### 20. Instructor Do: Recap / Where's the crypto in crypto? (5 min)

Now that the students have a fundamental understanding of cryptography, and how a blockchain is built using these concepts and data structures, it's time to review and put a cap on the day.

First, congratulate and encourage the students for getting through one of the hardest and conceptually abstract days of this section. They are now equipped with knowledge of blockchain *and* security.

Ask the students the following questions:

* So where's the "crypto" in cryptocurrency?

  **Answer**: It's an adage to the cryptography that is **heavily** used throughout the system.

  **Answer**: You could almost call it "cryptography currency" and get away with it.

* What is a hash?

  **Answer**: A one-way fingerprint of data, usually represented as a long string of alphanumeric characters.

* What is symmetric cryptography?

  **Answer**: A type of cryptography that uses a single, preshared key for encryption.

* What is asymmetric cryptography?

  **Answer**: AKA "public key cryptography" -- Cryptography that uses a pair of keys, public and private, for encrypting and signing messages.

* What is a (digital) signature?

  **Answer**: A message that can be cryptographically validated for its authenticity and integrity.

* Where is the "chain" in blockchain?

  **Answer**: Blocks are connected via a chain of hashes, giving the structure its name and security.

Remind the students that cryptography is a tough subject that is taught usually in a Computer Science degree and that they should be proud of learning it.

Cryptography is something that few people understand but powers many systems that keep our information secure every day.

Answer any questions before ending the class.
