### 20. Instructor Do: Recap / Where's the crypto in crypto? (15 min)

Now that the students have a fundamental understanding of cryptography, and how a blockchain is built
using these concepts and data structures, it's time to review and put a cap on the day.

First, congratulate and encourage the students for getting through one of the hardest and conceptually abstract
day of this section. They are now equipped with knowledge of blockchain *and* security.

Ask the students the following questions:

  * So where's the "crypto" in cryptocurrency?

    * **Answer**: It's an adage to the cryptography that is **heavily** used throughout the system.

    * **Answer**: You could almost call it "cryptography currency" and get away with it.

  * What is a hash?

    * **Answer**: A one-way fingerprint of data, usually represented as a long string of alphanumeric characters.

  * What is symmetric cryptography?

    * **Answer**: A type of cryptography that uses a single, preshared key for encryption.

  * What is asymmetric cryptography?

    * **Answer**: AKA "public key cryptography" -- Cryptography that uses a pair of keys, public and private, for encrypting and signing messages.

  * What is a (digital) signature?

    * **Answer**: A message that can be cryptographically validated for its authenticity and integrity.

  * Where is the "chain" in blockchain?

    * **Answer**: Blocks are connected via a chain of hashes, giving the structure it's name and security.
