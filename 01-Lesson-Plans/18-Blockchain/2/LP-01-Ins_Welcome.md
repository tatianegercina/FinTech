## 18.2 Lesson Plan: Basic Cryptography

### Overview

Today's class will introduce students to the fundamental cryptographic techniques used throughout blockchain and internet
technologies.

The goal of this lesson is to have the students understand and apply basic cryptographic concepts to their daily lives as
well as to arbitrary data, understanding the significance and applications of these techniques.

### Class Objectives

By the end of the class, students be able to:

* Describe what cryptography is used for.

* Describe what a hash is.

* Hash a payload.

* Explain what asymmetric keys are.

* Sign a message with a private key.

* Verify a message with a public key.

* Explain the significance of asymmetric cryptography in the context of blockchain.

* Explain the use of crypto in a blockchain network.

* Explain the basic blockchain data structure.

Welcome to the cryptography fundamentals part of the course. In today's class you will be covering the basic cryptographic
techniques that blockchain technology, as well as the rest of the internet, is built upon.

  * Ask the students to raise their hand if they have heard of:

    * Encryption

    * Digital Signatures

  * Ask the students to raise their hand if:

    * They have ever used a password to protect something like their cell phone, computer, social media, etc.

    * They have ever used an encrypted messaging service.

Point out that students may have seen cryptography in action when browsing the internet over HTTPS by pointing out the "green lock"
in the URL bar of their web browsers.

  * Describe that this means that this means the communication between you and the website is
    "encrypted" so that nobody else on the network can see the information.
