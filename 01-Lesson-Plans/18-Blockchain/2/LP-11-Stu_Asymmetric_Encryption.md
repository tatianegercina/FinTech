### 11. Students Do: Asymmetric Encryption (10 min)

Students will get into pairs of 2 and encrypt and decrypt messages between each other using
asymmetric encryption instead of symmetric.

* **Files:**

  * [README.md](Activities/11-Stu_Asymmetric_Encryption/README.md)

Have TAs circulate and ensure that students are successfully encrypting and decrypting each other's messages.

### 12. Instructor Do: Asymmetric Encryption Review (5 min)

Ask the students the following questions:

  * What is the biggest benefit to using asymmetric encryption over symmetric?

    * **Answer**: You do not need to share a key beforehand.

    * **Answer**: Only the recipient and the sender can decrypt the payloads.

  * What is the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?

    * **Answer**: You have a single, private key with symmetric, versus having a pair of keys for public and private use in asymmetric.
