### 3. Instructor Do: Hashing Demo (10 min)

* **Files:**

  * [solution.py](Activities/03-Ins_Hashing/Solved/solution.py)

* Walk through the solution and highlight the following:

  * Notice how each hash is different, even though only one character was changed in the input

  * Notice that no matter what, the same input will give the same hash output, it's a one to one relationship.

  * Ask the students if the output of the hash looks familiar, and where they might have seen them so far:

    * **Answer**: Transaction IDs

    * **Answer**: Block hashes

  * Point out that addresses are actually derived from hashing as well, but are not purely hashes as they will learn later today.
