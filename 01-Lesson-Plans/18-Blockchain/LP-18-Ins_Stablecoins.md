### 2. Instructor Do: Stablecoins (10 mins)

Walk through the solution and highlight the following:

* Stablecoins are tokens created on the blockchain that represent some form of underlying asset.

* They are tokens designed to represent fiat currency at a 1:1 ratio

* They help the adoption of blockchain without the price volatility associated with other cryptocurrencies.

* Stablecoins can be backed by different types of underlying assets.

* The first is fiat-collateralized where the coin is backed by fiat, government currency.

Ask the class: "Have you heard of any fiat-collateralized stablecoins, if so which ones?"

  **Answer** Tether's USDT

  **Answer** Gemini's "Gemini Dollar" (GUSD)

  **Answer** Circle's "USD Coin" (USDC)

  **Answer** Paxos

* The second is crypto-collateralized, where smart contracts act to balance the price based on market conditions.

Ask the class if they have heard of any crypto-collateralized stablecoins, and if so, which:

  **Answer** MakerDai (DAI)

  **Answer** Synthetix (nUSD)

* A popular example is Dai issued by Maker. While Dai is pegged to the US Dollar, the stablecoin itself is backed by Ether.
  Algorithms maintain the exchange rate between Ether and Dai to ensure parity against the US Dollar.

* Another option is commodity-collateralized, where non-liquid assets are used to back the stablecoin.
  Normally this include assets like gold and silver, but Venezuela issued a coin
  backed by its oil reserves called "Petrocoin". Each coin is said to be backed by a barrel of oil.
  However, the Petrocoin has not gained global credibility as a viable coin.

* The last, least common and most difficult to implement is purely algorithmic stablecoins that are not
  collateralized by any asset, but rather the price is determined by an algorithm that adjusts the coin supply
  against market capitalization to create a stable reference value. This is also called Seigniorage-style.
