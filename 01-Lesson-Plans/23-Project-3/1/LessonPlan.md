### Please take the End-Course Instructional Staff Survey if You Haven't Yet

Trilogy, as a company, values transparency and data-driven change quite highly. As we grow, we know there will be areas that need improvement. It’s hard for us to understand what these areas are unless we’re asking questions. Your candid input truly matters to us, as you are key members of the Trilogy team. In addition to the individual feedback at the end of lesson plans, we would appreciate your feedback at the following link if you have not already taken the end-course survey:

#### Overview

This week, students will work on their final project of the boot camp: FinTech Blockchain.

#### Instructor Notes

Students are allowed to choose groups for their final project. However, some students may request to be placed into a group. Make sure that every student is paired with at least one other student for the final project.

Students are also allowed to focus their project on any topic from any section of the course. This allows them to align the project with their career goals as a final capstone to the course.

It is highly recommended to request project proposals from students and then approve their proposals. Students will often struggle with setting realistic goals, so use this as an opportunity to guide them to unique, interesting, and achievable projects.
