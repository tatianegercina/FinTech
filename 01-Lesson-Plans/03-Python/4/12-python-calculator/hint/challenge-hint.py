# declare a variable called user_input_list and set it to an empty list for now

# create a string of all the valid_inputs for our validation logic to check against user's input


# ==================== Evaluation Function ====================
#

# Feel free to come back to this function later if you want to.
# We will not be using this immediately.

# Define a function that takes in user_input_list to check the operator's sign

    # if the operator is a '+' sign, return the value of the first number added to the second number
    
    # else if the operator is a '-' sign, return the value of the first number subtracted from the second number

    # else if the operator is a '*' sign, return the value of the first number multiplied by the second number

    # else if the operator is a '/' sign, return the value of the first number divided by the second number

#
# =============================================================


# Declare For each of the following 3 variables, one for the first number, one for the second, and one for the operator.
  # Set confirmed_input = false

  # While confirmed_input = false

    # if user_input is in list of valid_inputs
      # Then append user_input to user_input_list
      # Update confirmed_input = true

    # else print "User input is not a valid input."



# Declare a variable called calculator_result set it to the function defined in the previous step.

# Print the user's equation requested by concatenating the user_input_list and the value of calculator_result.
# Output example: 1 + 3 = 4
