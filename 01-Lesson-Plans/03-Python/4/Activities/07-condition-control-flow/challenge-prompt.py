# Create a variable called 'farm'
# set that farm variable to be a list with the elements
# pig, cow, chicken, dog, horse, sheep


# Write an if statement that prints the string "RWAR!" if the first element of farm is not "Godzilla"


# Write another if statement that prints the string "SCREECH!" if the last element of farm is "Mothra"


# Declare a variable named 'dog' with a string of "Spot"


# declare 3 variables cat, city, car without assigning them values


# assign the string "Farley" to cat

# assign the string "San Francisco" to city


# assign the string "Prius" to car


# using string concatenation, print out the sentence 
# "See Spot run!" without explicitly using "Spot" inside the string.


# using string concatenation, print out the sentence 
#"I drive Farley around San Francisco in my Prius" without explicityly 
#using "Farley", "San Francisco", and "Prius"
# Remember to use the variables we just declared!


# declare a variable budget and assign it a value of 5000


# declare a variable rent_cost and assign it a value of 1500


# declare a variable utilities_cost and assign it a value of 150


# declare a variable food_cost and assign it a value of 250


# declare a variable transportation_cost and assign it a value of 350


# declare a variable computer_cost and assign it a value of 2000


# Declare a variable called total_cost that takes the sum of all costs above (excluding budget).


# write an if statement that checks whether the sum of all our costs is within the budget.
# if it is within budget, print "You're total cost is " with the total cost, 
# otherwise, print "You're over budget by " difference of budget vs total cost.



# write an if statement that checks whether the rent_cost is larger than 
# the sum of the utilities_cost, food_cost, and transportation_cost
# and if computer_cost is greater than the sum of rent_cost and utilities_cost
# if both those statements are true, print a string that says "This computer is too expensive!"
# else,print a string that says "Rent is too damn high!"
