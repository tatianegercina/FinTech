# Making a Calculator #

### This activity is going to combine everything we've covered today along with some tools from yesterday. We're going to be making a very basic arithmetic calculator that takes in user input and returns the result of the calculation. This is a challenging activity, so remember that there's always the hints folder for you to lean on ###

* This calculator should only take numbers, `+`, `-`, `*` and the `/` key as valid inputs

* It is highly recommended you use functions to section out your logic and validate each of the user's input so that they are unable to add multiple operators.
