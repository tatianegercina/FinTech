# CSV Practice

In this exercise, you will import a csv file and loop through its data. Put your trainer caps on because we're going to be reading Pokemon data. All 807 pokemon to be exact!

This excercise is meant to provide additional practice in importing a csv, reading its data and searching through the data for given paramaters using for loops and if statements.

If you get stuck look at the in class activities (specifically 07 and 08) for additional help!
Hint:  `str` and `int` types cannot be evaluated against each other and must be converted to be the same data type.
