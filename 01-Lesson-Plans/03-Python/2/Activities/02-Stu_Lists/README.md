# Sugar, Flour, Butter!

 ## Background
 
 Mike needs to plan his grocery list so that he can buy the ingredients needed to make some delicious apple pie. Help Mike create and modify his list of groceries before he leaves for the supermarket. Then help him cross off items as he gathers the ingredients he needs.

## Instructions

Use the [starter-file](Unsolved/Core/grocery_list.py) to complete the following steps.

* Create a grocery list for the apple pie ingredients: 

  * water
  * butter
  * eggs
  * apples
  * cinnamon
  * sugar
  * milk

* Find the first two items on Mike's grocery list.

* Find the items except for the first two items on Mike's grocery list.

* Find every other item, starting from the second item, on Mike's grocery list.

*  Add `flour` to the grocery list.

* Mike decides to be more specific with the types of apples needed, so change `apples` to `gala apples`.

* Determine the total number of items on the grocery list.

## Challenge

Mike arrives at the supermarket and walks through the aisles to gather the items on the list. 

* Mike wants to find where `gala apples` is on his list. Find the index of `gala apples`.

* Mike remembers that he already has sugar. Remove `sugar` from the grocery list.

* Mike decides that he has water at home. Remove `water` from the grocery list based on its index.

* Mike decides to pick up the last item on his list, so remove the last item from the grocery list.
