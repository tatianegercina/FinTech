## Conditionally Yours

Harold just returned from a meeting with his supervisor with a huge grin on his face. Thanks to your program, Harold was able to spend more time making decisions about which stocks to buy and sell, and he now has the second highest profit earnings for the week. You get lunch together, and while at lunch, you start posing ideas about how the program can be taken to the next level. Harold's ears perk up when you mention that you can add in additional logic that identifies whether or not a stock should be purchased based off of the percent increase or decrease in stock price. Harold knows that this would allow him to focus only on buying and selling; the program would handle all decision making and get him one step closer to securing the title of top trader for this week and the weeks to come. You two begin considering the requirements for the enhanced program.

For this activity, work with a partner to create pseudocode for a program that will:

* Calculate percent increase or decrease in stock price for Netflix

* Identify a viable percent increase/decrease percentage that will indicate buy/sell action. Otherwise, assume a 20% increase or decrease in stock price should warrant buy/sell action

* Use conditional statements to determine whether or not a stock should be purchased or sold

Increase = Current Price - Original Price

Percent Increase = Increase / Original x 100

## Instructions

Using the [starter-file](Unsolved/conditionally_yours.py) provided, complete the following steps:

1. Pseudocode variable declaration

2. Pseudocode `percent_increase` calculation

3. Pseudocde `IF-ELSE` logic to determine buy/sell recommendation

**Hint**

* Start by writing the logic out in plain English. Then, refine it into pseudocode.
