## The Conditional Conundrum

Like you, your co-worker Sam is studying conditional statements. You two have decided to quiz each other on your ability to understand logical decision making. Sam has created a Python script with some conditional statements for your review. Follow the instructions below and complete Sam's quiz.

### Instructions

* Open the [starter-file](Unsolved/conditionals.py). Look through the examples and figure out what the output would be for each conditional statement.

* Do not run the code at first, see if you can follow the thought process and guess.

* Once you've guessed, run the file.
