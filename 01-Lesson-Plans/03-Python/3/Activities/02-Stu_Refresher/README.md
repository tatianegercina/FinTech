# Refresher Activity: Email Marketing

## Background

A company's marketing department wants to understand the differences in purchasing activity among the firm's customers in order to create personalized email newsletters for each customer.

Harold has been asked to categorize customers based on their sales revenue and assign a business tier: Platinum, Gold, Silver, or Bronze. Then, depending on the assigned business tier, he needs to generate a personalized message for each customer.

Help Harold create a program that will achieve the marketing department's goals––and impress them!

## Instructions

* Create a function named `create_phrase` that takes in `name` and `revenue` as parameters, and returns a dynamic greeting based on revenue conditionals:

  * Platinum = 3001+
  * Gold = 2001–3000
  * Silver = 1001–2000
  * Bronze = 0–1000

* Create a for loop that iterates through `customers` and prints out the constructed greeting for each customer.
