# PyViz Installation Guide

PyViz is a Python visualization package that provides a single platform to access multiple visualization packages, including Matplotlib, Plotly Express, hvPlot, Panel, D3.js, etc.

Follow the steps below to install and set up PyViz in your Python environment. These steps should be completed outside of class.

**NOTE:** Make sure that you are using your conda environment that has anaconda installed. If necessary, create a new environment for this lesson using:

```shell
conda create -n pyvizenv python=3.7 anaconda
conda activate pyvizenv
```

1. Download the PyViz dependencies **nodejs** and **npm** (included in nodejs).

    ```shell
    conda install -c conda-forge nodejs
    ```

2. Use the `conda install` command to install the following packages. Note: On some of these installs, you may get a message that says that the requested packages are already installed. That is fine. Conda is really good at installing all of the required dependencies between these tools.

    ```shell
    conda install -c pyviz pyviz
    conda install -c pyviz holoviz
    conda install -c pyviz hvplot
    conda install -c plotly plotly
    conda install -c pyviz panel
    ```

3. PyViz installation also requires the installation of Jupyter Lab extensions. These extensions are used to render PyViz plots in Jupyter Lab. Execute the below commands to install the necessary Jupyter Lab extensions for PyViz and Plotly Express.

  * Avoid "JavaScript heap out of memory" errors during extension installation

    ```shell
    # (OS X/Linux)
    export NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=4096

    # (Windows)
    set NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=4096
    ```

  * Install the Jupyter Lab extensions

    ```shell
    jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager@1.1 --no-build

    jupyter labextension install jupyterlab-plotly@4.6.0 --no-build

    jupyter labextension install plotlywidget@4.6.0 --no-build

    jupyter labextension install @pyviz/jupyterlab_pyviz
    ```

  * Build the extensions (This may take a few minutes)

    ```shell
    jupyter lab build
    ```

  * After the build, unset the node options that you used above.

    ```shell
    # Unset NODE_OPTIONS environment variable
    # (OS X/Linux)
    unset NODE_OPTIONS

    # (Windows)
    set NODE_OPTIONS=
    ```

4. Use the `conda list | grep pyviz` function to confirm installation of all PyViz packages. Look for version numbers with at least the following versions:

    ```shell
    conda list | grep pyviz
    ```

    ```shell
    holoviz                   0.11.3
    hvplot                    0.5.2
    panel                     0.9.5
    ```

5. Use the `conda list | grep plotly` function to confirm all Plotly packages are available. Make sure that you have the following version installed:

    ```shell
    conda list | grep plotly
    ```

    ```
    plotly                    4.6.0
    ```

6. You will also need to register for a public mapbox API key. You can find detailed installation instructions on [Plotly's documentation page](https://plotly.com/python/scattermapbox/#mapbox-access-token-and-base-map-configuration).

Now you're all set to get started creating visual masterpieces using PyViz technologies!

## Troubleshooting

If you have issues with PyViz or Jupyter Lab, you may need to update your Conda environment. Follow the steps below to update the environment and then go back to the install guide to complete a fresh installation of PyViz.

1. Deactivate your current Conda environment. This is required in order to update the global Conda environment. Be sure to quit any running applications such as Jupyter prior to deactivating the environment.

```
conda deactivate
```

2. Update Conda.

```
conda update conda
```

3. Create a fresh Conda environment to use with PyViz.

```
conda create -n pyvizenv python=3.7 anaconda
```

4. Activate the new environment.

```
conda activate pyvizenv
```

5. Install the PyViz dependencies following the guide above.
