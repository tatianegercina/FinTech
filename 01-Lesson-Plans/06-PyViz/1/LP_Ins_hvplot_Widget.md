**Files:**

* [Slides]()

* [solution.py](Activities/01-Ins_Really_Important/Solved/solution.py)

Open the solution file, and highlight the following:

* The hvPlot widget bar gives users the ability to choose how they want to interact with the data.

* The widgets bar includes buttons for the following interactions:

  * Panning

  * Box Zoom

  * Wheel Zoom

  * Save visualization

  * Hover

* Panning allows users to move the data on the screen in all directions. This is particularly valuable when trying to view dat across time, outlying data points, or even high volume. Instead of having to zoom out to see all data, panning brings data into the forefront of the visualization as needed.

* The box zoom interaction zooms into data points based off of a selection drawn.

* Wheel zoom works similar to box zoom; however, the click wheel is used magnify data points.

* Another way to interact with visualizations is to save them. hvPlot allows visualizations to be saved as html documents for later use.

* Hovering is also a key interaction. Hovering over a value in a visualization shows the actual value for that data point.
