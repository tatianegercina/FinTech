Instruct students to turn and find a partner to demo their visualizations and customizations to. Encourage students to teach one another different tricks and shortcuts they may have learned along the way, as well as to provide constructive criticism to help make the visualizations more appealing and insightful.

Emphasize to students that the activity should focus on how they used the `opts` function and other customization attributes to perfect their visualizations. Use the below discussion points/questions to guide the review session, when/if needed.

* The `opts` function

* Customizing x and y axes
