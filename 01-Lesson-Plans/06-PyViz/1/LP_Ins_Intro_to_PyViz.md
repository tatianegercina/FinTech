### 6. Instructor Do: Intro to PyViz (10 minutes)

Students will be introduced to PyViz by way of a facilitated discussion led by the instructor. The discussion will focus on the advantages of using PyViz rather than individual technologies (i.e. Holoviews, Matplotlib, d3.js, etc.).

**Files:**

* Slides

Communicate to students that the Python environment comes packed with a number of different visualization technologies that have all been wrapped together into one platform called PyViz.

Navigate to the 6.1 slides, and highlight the following:

* PyViz is a data visualization ecosystem that gives developers an easy way to access multiple data visualization libraries at one time.

* Each visualization technology in the PyViz ecosystem has the power and features to provide stand-alone visualizations. Each technology also has its strengths and weaknesses, which will be explored later.

* PyViz’s platform allows for different visualization technologies to be integrated with one another to create dashboards (which can be done with PyViz’s Panel software).

Facilitate discussion by asking the following questions:

* Let’s say I just wanted to use Matplotlib and Holoviews. Why not just download those technologies specifically rather than installing PyViz?

  * **Answer** Matplotlib and Holoviews may not satisfy all of the visualization needs required. For example, Matplotlib and Holoviews provide visualizations, but they do not offer a way to create a dashboard. Installing PyViz will ensure all viable technologies are accessible.

  * **Answer** Installing PyViz instead of just the individual technologies would mean that you’d get access to the individual technologies, as well as the integration architecture that PyViz uses to integrate the libraries.
* What other environment have we worked in that resembles the PyViz environment?

  * **Answer** The Anaconda environment

Ask if there are any questions; then, move onto the next module.
