### 14. Instructor Do: Intro to Interactive Visualizations (5 mins)

Students participate in a facilitated discussion led by the instructor regarding the different types of chart interactions that are capable with hvPlots.

**Files:**

* [Slides]()

Facilitate discussion with students by asking the following guided questions.

* Ask students to describe what interactive visualizations are/means to them.

  * **Answer** Interactive visualizations are charts and graphs that can be changed based off of user actions.

* Ask students to explain the value behind interactive visualizations.

Navigate to the 6.1 slides, and highlight the following:

* Define interactive visualizations as charts and graphs that can be manipulated by user interaction. Example interactions include clicking, panning, and zooming, all of which come out of the box with hvPlot.

* Underscore that interactivity is important to visualizations because it allows users to explore data without having to query data. With just a click, data can be sorted, re-arranged, filtered, panned, etc.

Ask if there are any questions before moving forward.
