### 3. Instructor Do - The Importance of Data Visualization (5 mins)

For this activity, the instructor will lead a formal lecture regarding what data visualization is and why it’s important.

**Files**

* Slides

Navigate to the Unit 6.1 slides, and highlight the following:

* Working with large amounts of data often means having to run a bunch of manual queries to slice and dice data.

* Present students with the following scenario:

  * Imagine working for a large bank like TD Ameritrade and being asked to analyze all of their consumer transaction data for a fraud prevention and anti-money laundering initiative. All that’s provided is an Excel file with all transactions made from customers living in the U.S.

  * Ask: What’s your first step when trying to analyze this data?

    * **Answer**: Run away
    * **Answer**: Filter the data to narrow it down
    * **Answer**: Categorize the data into segments, and then filter from segments (i.e. investments vs. purchases)

Explain to students that trying to analyze large amounts of data typically results in the following:

* Increased wait time for analysis to completed

* Data issues are not spotted until after analysis has begun

* Analysis doesn’t reflect entire data sets

A key way to avoid these pitfalls is to analyze data using visualizations. Highlight the following:

* Visualizations allow data to be coded and categorized in a way that improves analytic thinking. For example, similar data points can be grouped or color coded in order to visually display relationships

* Trends in data can more easily be spotted when data is visualized. Instead of spotting the trends numerically, the trends can be identified by color, size, shape, etc.

* Visualizations allow users to interact with the data. Interactive visualizations allow data to be sliced and diced on the fly by each individual user. This allows visualizations to be even more customized to fit the analytic/user needs. For example, one user of a data visualization might zoom in on data values to see more granular trends. Another user might keep things high level for a more holistic analytic approach.

* Because visualizations need to be aesthetically pleasing and practical, as well as interactive, many companies have created packages and libraries that offer free visualization themes and blueprints. No matter the type of visualization, there’s most likely a library to provide it. Example visualizations include:

  * Standard charts (line, bar, etc) but with interactive widgets

  * Comparative visualizations that visualize differences and relationships between datasets

  * Geographic visualizations for visualizing heat maps and geographical data elements and cartographical needs.

If time remains, engage students by asking if there are any types of data visualizations they’ve seen in their experience that were cool or striking to them.

Ask if there are any questions before moving forward.
