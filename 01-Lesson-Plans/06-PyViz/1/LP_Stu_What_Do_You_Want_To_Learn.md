### 4. Students Do: What do you want to learn? (10 minutes)

In this activity, students will engage in a thought experiment to get them thinking about the different ways they’d like to visualize data. Students can work together to exchange and talk about ideas. Each student will need to name a visualization they’re interested in learning.

Student answers will be saved for review at the end of the lesson. These will serve as a list of visualizations for students to look up on their own time and explore further. The list will also be used internally to identify the best visualizations to teach going forward.

### 5. Instructor Do: What Do You Want to Learn Activity Review (5 minutes)

For this activity, the instructor will lead a facilitated review discussion regarding the different types of visualizations the students would like to see.

**Files**

* Example visualizations

Open the example visualizations link, and ask students the following question. Wait for volunteers; if no one volunteers, go round robin.

* Of the different visualizations provided as examples, which visualization are you most interested in learning how to create?

  * **Answer** Parallel Coordinates

  * **Answer** Parallel Categories

  * **Answer** Violin

  * **Answer** Heatmap

  * **Answer** Word Cloud

If time remains, provide students with some information regarding your favorite types of visualizations or visualizations you might have worked on in the past. Another option is to list some of the common visualizations that are seen in the field.

Ask students if there are any questions; if not, continue to the next activity.
