Welcome to Unit 6! Unit 6 is dedicated to introducing and teaching students all they need to know about data visualization using the PyViz visualization platform.

Navigate to the 6.1 slides, and highlight the following:

* Visualizations have already been used in class (Matplotlib plots). However, these visualizations have been static. While static visualizations are help in displaying data, the data cannot be interacted or explored in the same way. For this reason, students will learn how to create interactive plots.

* In order to create interactive plots, users need to be able to access visualization libraries and packages that offer interactive visualizations. Otherwise, the visualizations would have to be coded manually, which can be extremely cumbersome.

* PyViz is a data visualization ecosystem made specifically for Python. PyViz itself works as a wrapper around these various technologies
  * Example visualization technologies included with PyViz are hvPlot, Plotly Express, and Panel.

* PyViz aims to provide a single stop-and-shop space for all data visualization needs.

* The creators of PyViz recognize that one technology or package cannot solve all data visualization needs, and so, the creators have created PyViz as a means to provide developers with a platform that enables more than one data visualization package being used for a project.

Transition into a demonstration of the types of visualizations that can be made using PyViz:
Interactive visualizations allow data to be explored and analyzed in the most efficient and effective manner for human eyes.

* Interactive visualizations give users the ability to pan, zoom, and filter data elements and values

* Interactive visualization also include functionality that allows data to be sorted off of different values based off of a simple click

End the module communicating to students that gone are the days where simple line, bar, and histogram charts satisfied data visualization and data analysis needs. Students will now learn how to create interactive and innovative visualizations that satisfy data exploration AND data analysis needs.

Ask for any questions before proceeding.
