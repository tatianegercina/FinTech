### 8. Students Do: System Check (10 minutes)

In this activity, students will work in pairs to confirm everyone has PyViz installed.

Instructor and TAs should circulate to provide assistance to anyone who experienced environment issues when installing PyViz. At this time, the instructor should find a group and ask if they'd like to volunteer to quickly summarize the install process, time permitting.

**Files**

* [PyViz Install Guide]()

* [README.md](Activities/08-Stu_System_Check/README.md)

If time remains after students have completed the check, ask for the chosen group to summarize the install process. Use the below question as a starting point:

* What are the required steps for setting up Panel? For example, the first step is to ensure all dependencies have been installed and the conda environment updated. What's next?

  * **Answer** The second step is to install the PyViz packages. These can be done using the `conda install` or  `pip install` commands. The packages that need to be downloaded are:

    * Plotly Express

    * Jupyter Lab extension for Plotly Express

    * PyViz with Panel

    * Jupyter Lab extension for PyViz

Ask if there are any questions before moving on.
