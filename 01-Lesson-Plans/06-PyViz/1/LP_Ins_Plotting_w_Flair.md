### 21. Instructor Do: Plotting with Flair (5 mins) (Optional)

In this optional activity, the instructor demonstrates to students how to create additional hvPlot types, such as **scatter** and **area** plots.

**Files:**

* [Slides]()

* [plotting_with_flair.ipynb](Activities/21-Ins_Plotting_with_Flair/Unsolved/plotting_with_flair.ipynb)

Explain to students that **line** and **bar** plots are just the tip of the iceberg in terms of what hvPlot supports.

* hvPlot also offers **area** and **scatter** plots. These plots are essential when visualizing and analyzing categorical/dimensional data at multivariate levels. An example would be considering real estate metric data across time, in terms of sales, foreclosures, and pending escrows.

* Because these plots support comparative analysis, they can be considered as more advanced than the standard **line** and **bar** plots.

Open the starter file, and live code the following. Make sure to highlight the corresponding discussion points during the demonstration.

* **Area** plots are a great way to visualize multivariate time analysis, time-series relationships, and progression over time. In addition to change over time, **area** charts also communicate the volume associated with trends and change over time. Whenever data needs to be analyzed over time, the `hvplot.area` function can be used to plot, visualize, and analyze the data.

  ```python
  import pandas as pd, numpy as np
  import hvplot.pandas

  # Prep data
  df  = pd.DataFrame({
    "foreclosed":np.random.randint(0,32,50),
    "sold":np.random.randint(0,32,50),
    "escrow":np.random.randint(0,32,50),
    "year":np.random.randint(2010,2019,50)}).sort_values('year')

  # Area plot
  df.hvplot.area(x='year',y=['foreclosed','sold','escrow'],xlabel='Year',ylabel='Total',title='2019 VA Q1 Real Estate Metrics',stacked=True)
  ```

* **Scatter** plots are a commonly used for showing how one data point is affected by another. For example, a real estate analyst might want to assess the correlation between number of foreclosures and houses currently in escrow across years. The `hvplot.scatter` function can help with visualizing the correlation. Execute the `hvplot.scatter` function against a Pandas DataFrame.

  ```python
  # Scatter Plot
  df.hvplot.scatter(x='foreclosed',y='escrow',xlabel='Foreclosed',ylabel='Escrow',c='year',cmap='viridis',colorbar=True,title='2019 VA Q1 Real Estate Metrics')
  ```
