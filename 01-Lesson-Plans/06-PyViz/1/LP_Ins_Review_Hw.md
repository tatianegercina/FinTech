Navigate to the Unit 6 Homework Instructions, and communicate the following to the students:

* This weekâ€™s homework focuses on visualizing and analyzing real estate data to identify the best properties in the San Francisco region.

* The homework includes using hvPlot and Plotly Express to create interactive data visualizations. These data visualizations will then be integrated with Panel in order to create a digital dashboard that contains multiple tabs.

* Creating interactive data visualizations allows the consumer of the data to explore the data and find structure, patterns, and insights that are important to them.

* In an investment scenario, offering a way to explore the real estate market interactively gives the investor the power to find properties that are of particular interest to them. In scenarios like these, it is the visualizations that help users make decisions.

Demo the homework solution by giving the students a preview of the solution.

Ask the students for any questions before moving forward.
