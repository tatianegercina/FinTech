### 9. Instructor Do: Intro to hvPlot (5 minutes)

Students participate in a formal lecture regarding what hvPlot is and what it has to offer in terms of data visualization.

**Files**

* [Slides]()

Navigate to the 6.1 slides, and introduce students to the world of hvPlots interactive graphs!

* Explain to students that hvPlot is a technology that brings plots to life.

* hvPlot abstracts over Python visualization libraries like Matplotlib, Pandas, and Streamz. The abstraction allows hvPlot to utilize the stand-alone plotting mechanisms of these technologies.

* This abstraction also allows hvPlot to transform the static plots (i.e. Matplotlib plots) into interactive sandboxes for data exploration and analysis. hvPlots allow for:

  * Panning

  * Zooming

  * Hovering

  * Clicking

  * Filtering

Encourage students to review some of the [example plots](https://hvplot.pyviz.org/) on their own time. Make sure ot slack out this link.
