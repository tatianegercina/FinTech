### 8. Students Do: Practice What the Instructor Just Covered (15 mins)

Students complete a bridge activity that involves them returning to a previous data set and visualizing the data using a **parallel coordinates** plot rather than a scatter plot.

Instruct TAs to circulate around the room to provide students assistance with rendering the **parallel coordinates** plots.

**Instructions:**

* [README.md](Activities/08-Stu_Parallel_Coordinates/README.md)

**Files:**

* [parallel_coordinates.ipynb](Activities/08-Stu_Parallel_Coordinates/Unsolved/parallel_coordinates.ipynb)
