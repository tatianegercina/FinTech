### 2. Instructor Do: Intro to Plotly Express (5 mins)

**Files:**

* [Slides]()

Navigate to the 6.2 slides, and highlight the following:

* **Plotly Express** works much like hvPlot, giving users a simple `plot` based interface that allows developers to create and customize interactive visualizations.

* **Plotly Express** is packaged and powered by the **Plotly** library, an open source graphing library for Python.

* * **Plotly Express** is a high level wrapper abstracted over **Plotly**, simplifying the work needed to create a visualization.

**Plotly** has a range of plot and chart types, skins, and colors; **Plotly** is th engine that generates **Plotly Express** figures.

* **Plotly Express** provides a simple `iplot` interface that can be used to create complex charts. Similar to the `hvplot` function, the `iplot` function accepts arguments that allow the visualizations to be customized.

Give students a preview of what can be created with **Plotly Express** by visiting the [Github page](https://plot.ly/python/plotly-express/) and showing students some examples of **Plotly Express** visualizations. All images have been retrieved from the [Plotly Express](https://plot.ly/python/plotly-express/) website. Make sure to highlight the following:

  * **Plotly Express** also comes with its own version of the standard plot types (i.e. scatter and line plots).

  * In addition to the chart types we've already seen (i.e. scatter, line, and bar), **Plotly Express** also includes charting types such as **Parallel Coordinates** and **Parallel Categories**, plot types that are useful when visualizing correlations and the relationships between data points.

  * If time remains, preview some of the other plots to the students, such as:

    * Density Contour

    * Density Heatmap

    * Maps

Ask for any questions, and then more onto the next activity.
