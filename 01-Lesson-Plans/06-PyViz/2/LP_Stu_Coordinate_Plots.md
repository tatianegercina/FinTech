### 8. Student Do: Plotting in Parallel (15 mins)

Students complete a bridge activity where they revisit a previously used data set that was visualized using scatter plots. Students now visualize the data using a **parallel coordinates** plot.

This will be the students' first time working with **parallel coordinate** plots. Instruct TAs to circulate to provide assistance. Encourage students who finish early to assist their classmates.

**Instructions:**

* [README.md](Activities/08-Stu_Parallel_Coordinates/README.md)

**Files:**

* [starter-code.js](Activities/08-Stu_Parallel_Coordinates/Unsolved/plotting_in_parallel.ipynb)

### 9. Instructor Do: Parallel Coordinates Activity Review (5 mins)

**Files:**

* [solution.js](Activities/08-Stu_Parallel_Coordinates/Solved/plotting_in_parallel.ipynb)

Open the solution and explain the following:

* X is used for Y.

* X can also be used for Z.

Ask for any remaining questions before moving on.
