### 11. Student Do: Categorical Property Evaluation (15 mins)

Students complete a MSMD activity and code out a **parallel categories** plot. Students will use the plot to visualize the dimensions/categories evaluated during real estate property evaluations.

Encourage students to work in teams and collaborate on the information seeking process. Indicate that even when working in teams each student will need to complete the activity.

Instruct the TAs to circulate to provide the teams with any troubleshooting assistance. Moreover, keep an eye out during the activity for students who finish early. Find a student volunteer who is wiling to present and describe the story being told by the documentation.
