# A Cartographer's Expedition

Harold's birthday is right around the corner! In addition to wanting to go to NYC, he has one other demand: no one can bring a cellphone. Harold wants everyone present and in the moment, un-distracted by technology. He will bring his phone, but it will only be used for emergencies.

Everyone's complaining about having to navigate the city without a GPS, but Harold is unrelenting. He wants to do the trek old school. Thinking about it, you realize that using an actual map might be pretty cool.

Instead of spending money on a map of NYC, become a true, modern cartographers and create interactive map plots that can be leveraged by you and your friends to get the lay of the city.

Work in teams of 2-3 people to

1. Identify 6-8 locations to visit

2. Use Plotly Express/Mapbox to plot the routes (point A to point B) for the expedition.

### Instructions

1. Read in the `harold_bday_plans.csv` data file.

2. Slice data for your **arriving airport** and the **first** location the group will visit.

3. Now plot a course to the **second** location. Continue to plot the courses until you've included **6-8 locations**.

4. Once you have 3 points on one map, create another map and plot the next set of locations.

5. Plot all locations on one map.

### Hint

Don't forget to plot your return to the airport.
