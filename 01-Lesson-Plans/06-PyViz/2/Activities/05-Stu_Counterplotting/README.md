# Plotly Counterplotting

Congratulations! You've been invited to the second round of the REMAX interview process for the Data Analyst role in the Business Intelligence department.

Now satisfied with your skills in **hvPlot**, the interviewers now want to better understand your competency using **Plotly Express**. REMAX currently uses the **Plotly** platform, so the team needs to confirm that you'll be a good fit for their current development ecosystem.

Using **Plotly Express** and the provided real estate data, determine which housing market is more fruitful and abundant: Maryland or Virginia. The goal is to demonstrate to the interviewers that you can understand real estate reporting requirements and develop visualizations that tell stories through data, especially as it relates to market targeting.

Complete this activity successfully, and you'll continue onto the next phase of the interview process.

## Instructions

1. Read in the Maryland housing data.

2. Read in the Virginia housing data.

3. Plot the Maryland housing data using the `plotly_express.scatter` function.

4. Customize the plot dimensionally and aesthetically. Make sure to specify the appropriate `x` and `y` axes for a **scatter** plot.

5. Plot the Virginia housing data using the `plotly_express.scatter` function.

6. Customize the Virginia plot dimensionally and aesthetically. Make sure to specify the appropriate `x` and `y` axes for a **scatter** plot.

5. Analyze the data, taking into consideration the key performance indicators for real estate markets. Identify the best market to target.

### Hint

Remember to take into consideration average sale prices, median sale prices, cost of living index, and number of sales. Each of these key performance indicators should help you decide which market is ripe and ready for picking.

Remember to tell a story with your data. This might mean sorting data values in a particular way or joining/composing datasets and plots.
