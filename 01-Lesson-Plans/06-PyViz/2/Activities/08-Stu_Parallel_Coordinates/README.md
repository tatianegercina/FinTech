# Plotting in Parallel

It's been about a week since your last interview with REMAX, and you're still waiting to hear back regarding an offer. In anticipation of the REMAX offer, you've been doing a lot of research about data visualization and the different types of statistical plots.

During your research, you came across a plot you've only seen offered with **Plotly Express**: the **parallel coordinate** plot.

While you're waiting to hear back from REMAX, take the initiative to revisit your latest REMAX submission. Work in parallel to enhance the report and learn the new plotting technique. This activity will improve your pre-existing work and advance your visualization chops. **Parallel coordinate** plots are great for performing impact analysis, which is key when assessing trends in the real estate market.
