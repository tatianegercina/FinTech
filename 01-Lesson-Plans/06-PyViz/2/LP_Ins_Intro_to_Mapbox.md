### 14. Instructor Do: Intro to MapBox API (5 mins) (Critical)

In this activity, students will be introduced to the MapBox API and geographical visualizations. The instructor will explain to students, in a formal lecture, what MapBox API is and how it's used.

**Files:**

* [Slides]()

Navigate to the 6.2 slides, and highlight the following:

* MapBox API is an open source API that gives developers a range of mapping visualizations and functions that enable the creation of interactive map plots.

* MapBox API is democratizing the map services industry (e.g. navigation and cartography), similar to how Plaid is doing for FinTech.

* MapBox offers three main services: maps, navigation, and search.

  * These services come with handy tools, such as map styles and vectors, map images and data sets, and live location.

* In addition to using MapBox tools and services to get information/objects, MapBox also provides a development arena for users to create their own maps. Developers looking to create their own content and materials can use the MapBox **SDK**.

  * Content created by developers is hosted on MapBox's servers, which allows the content to be embedded and consumed by web browsers, dashboards, mobile devices (IOS and Android).

  * Mapbox removes the requirement of developers having to host their own web services. Mapbox offers tiers of service, including a free tier and pay as you go services.

If time remains, ask the following guided question:

* A key dimension when analyzing financial data, especially at the global level, is geography/location. In what way could developers use MapBox to visualize financial data and create interactive plots?

  * **Answer** Mapbox could be used to visualize real estate sales and foreclosures over time, at the city, state, regional, and national levels.

  * **Answer** Mapbox could be used to create a heatmap depicting the areas with the highest cost of living indexes.

  * **Answer** Mapbox could be used to pinpoint the areas with the most expensive houses.

  * **Answer** Mapbox could be used to cluster the areas with the highest volume of Fintech/blockchain jobs.

  * **Answer** Mapbox could be used to convey the national and global median income
