### 1. Instructor Do: Welcome Class (5 mins)

**Files:**

* [Welcome-slides]()

Welcome students back! Indicate that today will start day 2 of interactive visualizations using PyViz.

* Begin the class explaining to students that **hvPlot** is not the only visualization package that can be used to create interactive visualizations. **Plotly Express** is a package similar to **hvPlot**, offering many of the same plots as **hvPlot** (i.e. bar, line, scatter, etc.) but more as well (i.e. **Parallel Coordinates** and **Parallel Categories plots**).

* Indicate that by the end of this class, students will have learned how to create visualizations using **Plotly Express**.

If time remains, provide students with some sample visualizations of the types of plots being made with **Plotly Express**. Use this [site](https://plot.ly/python/plotly-express/#visualize-distributions) for examples.

* Use the left navigation pane, and select the following pages. Remember to highlight and focus on how Plotly's unique plot types work towards telling a story.

  * [Scatter and Line Plots](https://plot.ly/python/plotly-express/#scatter-and-line-plots)

  * [Visualize Distributions](https://plot.ly/python/plotly-express/#visualize-distributions)

  * [Ternary Visualizations](https://plot.ly/python/plotly-express/#ternary-coordinates)

  * [Maps](https://plot.ly/python/plotly-express/#maps)

Ask if there are any questions before moving on.
