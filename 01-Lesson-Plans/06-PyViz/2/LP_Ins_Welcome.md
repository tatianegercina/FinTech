* [Welcome-slides]()

Welcome students back! Indicate that today will start day 2 of interactive visualizations using PyViz.

Begin the class explaining to students that **hvPlot** is not the only visualization package that can be used to create interactive visualizations. **Plotly Express** is a package similar to **hvPlot**, offering many of the same plots as **hvPlot** (i.e. bar, line, scatter, etc.) but more as well (i.e. **Parallel Coordinates** and **Parallel Categories plots**).

* **Plotly Express** is a favorite among the data science and web-based data visualization communities.

* **Plotly Express** is a leader in data visualization and supports multiple programming languages, like Python, JavaScript, and R.

* Emphasize that **Plotly Express** offers advanced statistical and financial charts that technologies are lacking in technologies like **hvPlot**.

* Indicate that by the end of this class, students will have learned how to create visualizations using **Plotly Express** and that they will have gained knowledge and skills that data scientists are currently using today in the industry.

If time remains, provide students with some sample visualizations of the types of plots being made with **Plotly Express**. Use this [site](https://plot.ly/python/plotly-express/#visualize-distributions) for examples.

* Use the left navigation pane, and select the following pages. Remember to highlight and focus on how Plotly's unique plot types work towards telling a story.
