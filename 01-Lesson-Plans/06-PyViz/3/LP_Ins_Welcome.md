Welcome back! Today marks the last unit of the PyViz Data Visualization unit. Today's lesson will take data visualizations to the next level and will focus on using Panel, a PyViz technology, to create dashboards.

Explain to students that dashboards are data platforms that host multiple reports and visualizations. Dashboards take data reporting to the next level by projecting curated and tailored charts and visualizations that measure performance and corresponding KPIs.

Emphasize that creating a dashboard is different than creating a report.

* Reports are used to help visualize underlying data and enable users to perform their own analysis of the data.

* Dashboards are used to consume data tailored to a specific reporting structure. The reporting structure will typically satisfy a business objective or evaluate performance based off of certain indicators.

* Dashboards can be used to consolidate multiple reports into one view. Structuring reports as parts of dashboards helps to create a robust reporting platform based off of a digital dashboard.

* Dashboards are great for monitoring data over time. Dashboards can be used to monitor stock/investment performance, personal budgets and savings, and/or available real-estate properties in a given area

Describe Panel as an open-source Python library that allows users to integrate widgets, plots, images, and text into a single dashboard.

* Panel offers a one-stop-shop for data visualization (curated to a specific reporting objective) where users leverage data visualizations and reports to evaluate KPIs.

* Indicate that Panel supports integration with each of the plotting libraries learned so far (i.e. Pandas, Matplotlib, hvPlot, Plotly).
