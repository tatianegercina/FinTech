### 14. Instructor Do: Dashboards as Webapps (5 mins) (Critical)

Students learn how to transform their Jupyter notebook dashboards into a webapp. The instructor will demonstrate how to use the `servable` command to execute and run the dashboard on a server.

**Files:**

* [dashboard_webapps.ipynb](Activities/14-Ins_Dashboard_Webapps/Solved/dashboard_webapps.ipynb)

Navigate to the 6.3 slides, and communicate the following:

* One of the advantages of using Panel for dashboarding is that Panel dashboards can be deployed as web apps: dashboard applications that are accessible over the internet rather htan just in a Jupyter notebook.

* Panel comes equipped with a `servable` function, which spins up a **Bokeh** server and launches the Jupyter notebook code as a webapp.

Open the starter file, and live code how to use the `servable function`.
