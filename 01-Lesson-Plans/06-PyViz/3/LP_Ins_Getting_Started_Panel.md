### 4. Instructor Do: Getting Started with Panel (5 mins)

Students will receive a small demo on how to use Panel at a high level.

**Files:**

* [getting_started_panel.ipynb](Activities/04-Ins_Getting_Started_Panel/Solved/getting_started_panel.ipynb)

Open the solved file, and give students a high level run down of how Panel works.

* Highlight to students that Panel depends on data or content already existing.

* When working with plots, its best to create a function to render the plot. The function can then be used with the `panel.interact` function, which will provide widgets for manipulating and changing function input values.

* These parameter widgets provide a convenient and easy way for users to change the values populating the visual, which is extremely handy when completing impact analysis.

  * It's important to note that this parameter widget is an added benefit provided by Panel. Not all dashboarding technologies provide this convenient feature.
