## Prework Module 1: What is Money?

---

### Overview

This module will introduce you to the concepts of value, money, and financial statements.

### Module Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

* Define value, as well as money, and how they differ from currency

* Identify the major features of money

* Identify the differences between commodity, representative, fiat, and crypto money

* Identify the three major types of financial statements reported by public companies

### Reading: Money and Value

To discuss the definition of money, we first need to define the concept of **value**, which is the perceived benefit derived from a good or service. For example, one may value apples for their intrinsic capacity as food. **Money** is a way in which we can measure value, and serves three main functions:

  * Unit of account: Money can serve as a direct numerical measurement of value for a good or service, acting as a standard description of value.

  * Medium of exchange: A useful form of money is accepted by a large number of participants in a market.

  * Store of value: Money should "generally" be stable relative to most of the goods and services it is exchanged for.

Money has had many forms throughout history, and we refer to physical money as currency. Some earlier forms include precious metals, gems, and seashells, which we refer to as commodity money. Later, we began to create money that represented discrete portions of those commodities which we call representative money.

In more recent years, most countries have moved away from representative money in favor of fiat money, which derives its value only from a government promise to back its value. While fiat money has no intrinsic value, it is beneficial as a medium of exchange within a country. For more on this topic, investigate the [Breton-Woods System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system) and [Nixon Shock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_shock).

Even more recently is the development of cryptocurrencies, which have exploded as a medium of exchange. Cryptocurrencies derive their usefulness as money from highly secure networks of computers solving difficult math problems. They are primarily a response to the 2008 Great Recession in which several governments printed a glut of new money (thus causing a fall in value from the excess supply). This was to an effort necessary to jumpstart the economy again, but it had the side effect of creating doubt in the role of government in managing the value of its own currency.

Most currencies also have three other properties, which are not necessary, but useful:

  - Fungibility: Each unit of currency is interchangeable

  - Scarcity: The currency is not easy for everyone to create more of, as generating more currency can debase its value

  - Portability: Currency should be easy to transport and exchange between parties.

### Reading: Financial Statements Used in Accounting

A **company** is a group of people endeavoring the advancement of a commercial or industrial purpose - that is, they are working together to create something of value. Companies can be public or private, with public companies being ones in which ownership can be purchased on an exchange. Both public and private companies are regulated by their industry, type, and scale by different departments of government. They raise financial capital through various means in order to provide goods or services. The two main fundraising vehicles are the issuance of bonds (selling debt, equivalent to taking out a loan) or selling shares (selling equity/ownership in the company). Smaller companies such as startups generally raise money through seed, angel, or venture capital (VC) investment.

Regardless of size, all companies require accounting, which is the practice by which governments, companies, and organizations measure their financial state. As a company grows, it is subject to ever more strict accounting standards, and public companies are required to report their accounting every year through official 10K (annual), and 10Q (quarterly) reports.

Accounting reports generally require three documents which we will cover here. However, there is far more to learn in a full accounting course! Those documents are the balance sheet, the income statement, and the cash flow statement.

The **balance sheet** is a statement of who owns what capital in the form of assets and liabilities. It tracks the fundamental accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Equity.  Assets are the physical and nonphysical resources owned by the company that adds a *positive* value to the balance sheet. They include things such as cash, real estate, and copyrights. Liabilities are similar to assets but are resources that add negative value to the balance sheets. These are items such as loans, wages owed, or the purchase of another company. Finally, equity is the leftover if all of the company's assets were sold, and debts were paid off (i.e., Equity = Assets - Liabilities). An example would be that if you were to purchase a home worth $200,000, and took out a loan for $160,000. Your equity in the home would be the $40,000 down payment. If the value of the house were to increase over the loan period, your loan is already contracted to a specific value, and thus your *equity* would increase. For those interested, there is also an [expanded accounting equation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expanded-accounting-equation.asp) that takes into account other features of a company's balance sheet.

The **income statement** is a statement of the total revenues and expenses for the company. It will also often be referred to as the P&L (pronounced P-N-L) statement. Where the balance sheet tracks all of what the company owns, as well as who owns it (i.e., assets and liabilities), the income statement tracks the company's performance in terms of money made (or lost!).

In the income statement, it all boils down to Net Income, which equals revenues (money made from selling things) minus expenses. Expenses for a company include typical things like the costs of purchasing from their suppliers (categorized as “cost of goods sold”), salaries and employee compensation (categorized as “general and administrative”), or real estate lease costs. For firms that borrow and thus have debt on the balance sheet, they also have to subtract the expense of paying interest on those loans. There is another expense known as depreciation, but this is an accounting concept that we don’t need to visit in detail (basically, it’s an expense whereby you subtract out the costs of buying large equipment or real estate over time, rather than all upfront. This has to do with tax rules).

The income statement gives investors a “bottom-line” answer as to whether the company earned (or lost) money, and if so, how much. For that reason, the income statement is often used in what is known as **Fundamental Analysis**, which we will discuss in a later section. We will often calculate the earnings-per-share (EPS) by dividing the total earnings of the company by the number of shares available.

The third and final statement, the **cash flow statement**, is used to understand the short-term viability of a company through demonstrating how changes in the balance sheet and income statement affect cash coming into and out of a company. In general, one can derive a cash flow statement from the combination of the balance sheet and income statement. The three major parts of the statement are the cash from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities.
