# Find a Statement

Now that we've discussed what is in a set of the most rudimentary financial statements let's explore what a real 10K or 10Q looks like.

## Instructions
Using EDGAR or a Google search, try to find a copy of a company's 10K or 10Q. Identify the three major statements within it. Are there any line-items that you haven't heard of? What are additional items contained in an official document that we haven't covered here?
