# Calculating TVM

In order to build some familiarity with the TVM equation, let's run through a quick practice problem

## Instructions

You are presented three opportunities for investment:

  - An investment that will be worth $20,000 after 2 years, compounding semi-annually at 5% interest

  - An investment that will be worth $15,000 after 1 year, compounding only once at 4% interest

  - An investment that will be worth $18,000 after 1 year, compounding semi-annually at 8% interest

Which investment values your present cash the highest? Which one seems riskiest? Which would you want to invest in? (Hint: This question does not have a straightforward answer)
