### Reading: What is a Market?

Quite simply, A market is a place - physical or digital - that people gather in order to exchange goods or services. While there are a panopoly of different types of markets, we will explore only a few of the most prominent ones here.

### Reading: Investing in Companies

Securities are tradable financial assets which derive their value from one of three main sources: the equity of a company, the debt of a company, or a derivative of one of the previous two.

In one of our previous modules, we learned that companies raise capital by selling either equity or debt. In the case of selling equity, the financial instrument used to make a sale is referred to as a stock. Generally, the owners of stocks have some say in how the company is run because the stock represents a partial ownership of the company. Stocks are often traded on a market known as a stock exchange such as the NASDAQ or the NYSE in the U.S. Their values tend to fluctuate throughout the day as those who are participating in exchanging stocks (traders) alter their beliefs about the future value of the company or stock in response to new information.

To avoid issuing ownership of the firm, some companies may instead issue corprate bonds, which are a financial instrument which sells the debt of the company; in effect it is a loan. Bonds are rated by the three major rating agencies: Standard and Poor's, Moody's, and Fitch, which help investers understand the credit risk associated with the investment.

Finally, there are a class of securities which derive their value based upon the perceived value of a company's stocks or bonds, which we refer to as derivatives. Two common examples are options and futures. Options are a contract for which the holder has the right (is allowed to) buy a security at a specified price at a later date. A future is very similar, but instead the contract holder is *obliged* to make the purchase. These derivative instruments represent a fascinating market in that the derivative instrument itself can be valued and thus traded as well!

Consider the situation in which I have a belief that Corning Incorporated (GLW) will be worth a higher value in three months than it is right now. I could simply buy the stock, wait for it to increase in value, then sell at a higher price. I could alternatively purchase an *option*, giving me the right to buy the stock at the date of contract expiration for a price that is lower than what stock value will be. Which path should I choose? In the scenario that I buy the stock, if it instead goes down, my investment has lost value. If I purchase an option and the stock goes down, I have only lost the value of my option purchase. If the stock goes up, and I bought the stock, I can sell for gains. If I purchased option contracts, the cost of the contract reduces my profits. In short, there are an endless variety for the ways in which you can choose to invest in securities, and many strategies you can employ to manage risk and returns.

### Reading: Investing in... Money?

Have you ever flown to a foreign country and needed to exchange your Dollars for some other currency? How are those prices set?Overshadowing the securities market in terms of trading volume is the foreign exchange market, also called Forex. In this market money of one type is exchanged for another, which are usually fiat currencies or cryptocurrencies. The prices on these markets also dictate the exchange rates offered around the world. The modern incarnation of the market is also an effect of the departure from teh Breton-Woods system mentioned in module 1. Post-1971 an increasing number of countries began to implement floating exchange rate systems which allowed their money to fluctuate in value relative to foreign markets. As a result, foresx markets became even more liquid and transaction volume began to increase dramatically.

Forex (sometimes abbreviated as FX) markets have three main instruments for exchanges. The spot markets are where two currencies are directly exchanged for one another. The second and third types of markets are considered derivatives. Forwards are a contract to swap two currencies at a future date, are typically a custom-tailored for a specific client or purpose, and are negotiated individually in an over-the-counter (OTC) transaction with an investment bank. Futures differ in that they are traded on a central exchange, can be re-sold, and have standardized features such as order size and pricing.

### Reading: Investing in Risk Management

When you make a large personal investment in something such as a car, how can you protect that investment against risks? If you get into a major accident, how will you pay back the loan? These are all questions of risk management that fall directly in the realm of insurance. Insurance is a contract that allows the holder to collect a financial sum when a particular event (usually a bad one) occurs. In exchange, the contract holder also agrees to pay the contract issuer a fee on a regular basis known as a premium. Groups of individuals may come together in order to seek a larger policy which simultaneously lowers the risk for the insurer and thus lowers the cost of premiums for the insured.

How do insurers determine the price of premiums and the dollar amount that they will cover? Insurance is a realm largely of statistics - determining the likelihood of certain types of events occurring and how much that event may cost. These statistical analyses come from a wide variety of sources, and we will discuss how they have changed dramatically with the incidence of machine learning. Insurance has continued to evolve and is sometimes referred to InsurTech when in the context of modern technologies.


### Reading: Investing in Real Estate

Finally, we have the real-estate markets - where tracts of land or buildings are purchased, sold, and rented out amongst market participants. States and countries have vastly differing rules and regulations regarding the ownership and transferral of real-estate. Additionally, investments in real-estate have a tendency to be illiquid and long-term. These features combined have contributed to real-estate markets historically being more resistant to technological change. However, change most certainly has arrived in the form of PropTech - technologies used to aid in the valuation, sale, management, and other informational purposes in the market.

If you were looking to make a real-estate investment, how would you go about deciding which plot of land would be the best value for your money? How would you know what the property is *actually* worth? This is another great opportunity to utilize the time value of money equation! If we have a belief about what the future value of the property is worth, we can *discount* the value back to today's dollars, in order to understand what a good price for the property could be.
