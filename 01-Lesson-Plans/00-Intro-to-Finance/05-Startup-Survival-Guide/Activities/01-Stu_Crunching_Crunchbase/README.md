# Crunching Crunchbase

In the previous section we covered the different funding stages of startups. In this activity we'll explore the different funding rounds for a few companies we may recognize.

## Instructions

Take a visit to [Crunchbase](crunchbase.com), a site that tracks the the amount of funding companies receive and what stage in their rounds that they are. Look into any company you're interested in working for, or one that is local to your city. Does the size of their funding surprise you? Who all provided funding for that company?
