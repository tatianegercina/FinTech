# Risk Reflection

In the previous section, we had you research types of risk, and in this one, we defined a few that are useful for this course. Of all of those, which are relevant to your day-to-day experiences?

## Instructions

Consider your current company (or a friend's company if you're not currently working), what kind of risks is that company exposed to? How do they mitigate risk? What kinds of risks that weren't discussed here are relevant to your role?
