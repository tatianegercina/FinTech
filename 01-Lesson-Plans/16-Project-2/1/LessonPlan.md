## 16.1 Lesson Plan—Projects & Collaboration with Git

#### Overview

In this week, students will begin work on their second project of the boot camp: FinTech Machine Learning.

#### Instructor Notes

The instructional staff should work together prior to class to identify the groups for this project. It often works best to pair students with similar skill levels so that all students are able to contribute equally to the project.

It is highly recommended to request project proposals from students and then approve their proposals. Students will often struggle with finding data sources and in setting realistic goals, so use this as an opportunity to guide them to unique, interesting, and achievable projects.

### 1. Instructor Do: Welcome Students (15 min)

Greet the class, and explain that today is the first day of Project 2!

Congratulate the class on having made it this far!

Explain that, over the next two class weeks, students will work in groups to complete a FinTech machine learning project.

Point out that this provides students with an opportunity to dive deeper into machine learning and create a really advanced FinTech project.

Explain that today's class will be dedicated to researching and creating a Project 2 proposal.

Use the slides to show the requirements for Project 2.

Break students into their project groups, and have them start to brainstorm ideas for their proposals. Each team should submit a proposal via GitHub to the instructor by the beginning of the next class.

* Be sure to slack out the Project's [Technical Requirements](../../../03-Projects/Project-02/TechnicalRequirements.md), the [Project Guidelines](../../../03-Projects/Project-02/ProjectGuidelines.md), the [Presentation Requirements](../../../03-Projects/Project-02/PresentationRequirements.md), and the [Presentation Guidelines](../../../03-Projects/Project-02/PresentationGuidelines.md) after going through the slides.

### 2. Student Do: Project Brainstorming and Proposals (Remaining Class Time)

Students will work with their groups to brainstorm project ideas and work on their project proposals. Project proposals should be finalized and submitted for instructor approval by the start of the next class.
