## 3.1 Lesson Plan: Python Review Day

### Overview

Today's class is an opportunity for students to review and practice fundamental programming skills in Python through a series of code drills.

### Instructor Notes

* Today's class will consist of Python code drills and review activities. Code drills are a simple way to build muscle memory and give students a chance to practice the fundamentals of programming in Python. Many of the code drills may seem trivial to some students, but the drills will help them become fluent in both syntax and basic problem solving.

* Code drills range in complexity and pace, so the time allotted to each section of activities should be fluid in order to allow each student to work through the problems at their own pace. You may find it helpful to review certain drills or activities with the entire class, but the majority of the time will likely be best served by rotating between groups of students to help them with any issues that they are having. This will also be a good time to see how they are feeling about Python in general and to give them some words of encouragement.

* One way to challenge students is to have "code drill races," where students pair off and race each other to complete a set of drills. However, use this strategy cautiously and thoughtfully so that you don't overwhelm any beginner programmers. 

* Overall, this should be a fun day for students that will help them build confidence in their programming skills. Be sure to offer plenty of support and encouragement to beginners.

* Reference the [Student FAQs](../../../06-Instructor-Resources/README.md) for answers to questions frequently asked by students of this program. If you have any suggestions for additional questions, feel free to log an issue or a pull request with your desired additions.

### 1. Instructor Do: Welcome Students (5 min)

Welcome students and explain that today's class will be a fun Python review day. Every student will get the opportunity to work with the instructional staff to answer any Python questions they have, but the majority of time will be spent working through a series of Python code drills.

Explain code drills to students:

* With any new skill––whether in sports, music, art, or programming––there is often a very steep learning curve when starting out. The good news is that there is a lot of research showing that focused daily practice can help you quickly progress toward mastery of any skill. This is especially true for programming.

* The key to learning to code is simply _to code_. Building strong daily coding habits will help build muscle memory that makes the process of typing code and remembering syntax easier.

* The goal is to practice coding in Python to the point where all of the syntax of the language becomes second nature. This allows you to use your mental power on problem solving and not on basic things like how to type a list or dictionary.

* Code drills are a way to help build that muscle memory. They are designed to provide basic practice with coding. The problems range from simple to complex, and they force you to focus on the fundamentals of the language.

Tell students that while they will be given all code drills at once, they should work through them at their own pace. Meanwhile, you and the TAs will be circulating the classroom to oversee student work and answer any questions they have. 

Encourage students to try to complete the simple code drills from memory, googling answers as needed.

### 2. Student Do: Code Drills (Remaining Class Time)

Students will be given the remaining class time to work through the code drills at their own pace.
