# More Practice with Variables and Logic Check

You will be getting more practice declaring, manipulating variables and if else statement in this exercise.

## Instructions

Perform the following:

1. Character One

    1. Make a variable called character_one_name and have it equal a string of Mr. Farley;

    2. Assign a new value, Ms. Farley, to the variable character_one_name.

2. Now give character one a age

    1. Make a variable called character_two_age and have it equal to a integer of 5 ;

    2. Assign a new value, 6, to the varibale character_two_age.

    3. Make a variable called character_one_salary and have it equal to 100000.00 ;

    4. Make a variable called character_one_profession and have it equal to "Web Developer"

    5. Make a variable called character_one_species and have it equal to "cat"

    6. Make a variable called character_one_location and have it equal to "San Francisco CA"

    7. Make a variable called character_one_rent and have it equal to "2000.00"

    8. Make a variable called character_one_expenses and have it equal to "1500.00"

    9. Make a variable called character_one_yearly_rent and have it equal to character_one_yearly_rent + 12

    10. Make a variable called character_one_yealy_expenses and have it equal to 1500.00 * 12

    11. Make a variable called character_one_savings and have it equal to character_one_yearly_rent + character_one_yealy_expenses

3. Character Two

    1. Make a variable of charcter_two_name equal to a string of "Mr. Snuggles"

    2. Make a variable of character_two_age equal to a age of 3

    3. Now redefine character_two_age to 4

    4. Make a variable called character_two_species and have it equal to "mouse"

    5. Make a variable called character_two_salary and have it equal to 

    6. Make a variable called character_two_location and have it equal to "Oakland, CA"

    7. Make a variable called character_two_rent and have it equal to "4000.00"

    8. Make a variable called character_two_expenses and have it equal to "500.00"

    9. Make a variable called character_two_yearly_rent and have it equal to character_two_yearly_rent + 12

    10. Make a variable called character_two_yealy_expenses and have it equal to 1500.00 * 12

    11. Make a variable called character_two_savings and have it equal to character_two_yearly_rent + character_two_yealy_expenses

4. Conditionals

    1. Write if statement to check if character_one_name is equal to "Mr. Farley", if it does == Mr. Farley then print a string of "Hello Mr. Farley"

    2. Write a else if and check if character_one_name == "Ms. Farley", if it does == Ms. Farley then print a string of "Hello Ms. Farley"

    3. Finally if they both don't apply else print a string of "Hello stranger"

    4. Write an if statement to check if character_two_age greater than character_two_age, if character_two_age is greater than character_two_age then print a string of "Mr. Farley", else print a string of "Ms. Farley"

    5. Write an if statement to check if character_one_location is equal to "Oakland", if character_one_location is equal to oakland print a string of "Raiders", else if character_two_location is equal to a string of "San Francisco", print a string of Niners, if both condition doesn't apply write an else with a print a string of "Warriors"

    6. Write an if statement to check if character_one_rent greater than character_two_rent, print a string of character_one_name with character_one_rent, else print a string of character_two_name with character_two_rent

    7. Write an if statement to check if character_one_expenses greater than character_two_expenses, print a string of character_one_name with character_one_expenses, else print a string of character_two_name with character_two_expenses

    8. Write if statement to check if character_one_profession equal to a string of "Web Developer" and character_two_Profession is a string of "Accountant", print a string of "Look a Web Developer and a Accountant", else if character_one_profession and character_two_Profession doesn't equal those strings then print a string of "They're professionals."

5. Execute the Python program.

    1. Open your terminal/git bash.

    2. From within the terminal/git bash run `source activate PythonData`Â to activate your virtual environment.

    3. Navigate to the directory that is holding this code drill.

    4. Run `python variables-01.py` to test your output.
