# Programming Challenge

This challenge is meant to strengthen your all-around coding skills and thinking. 

Unlike past challenges, the activities in this challenge do not focus on a single topic. They are meant to be brainteasers.

The instructions for each activity are in `challenge.py`. Feel free to approach them as you see fit.

Have fun!
