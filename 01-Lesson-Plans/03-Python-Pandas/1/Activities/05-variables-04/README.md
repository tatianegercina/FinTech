# More Practice with Variables and Logic Check

You will be getting more practice declaring and manipulating variables and checking logic in this exercise.

## Instructions

Perform the following:

1. Declare a variable of `boba_shop` with an input and a string of "Welcome to the Boba Shop! What is your name?".

2. Check if `name` is not an empty string or equal to `None`.

    1. If so, write a print with a string of "Hello" concatenated with the variable `name`.

    2. Then, declare a variable of `beverage` with an input and a string of "What kind of boba drink would you like?".

    3. Then, Declare a variable of `sweetness` with an input and a string of "How sweet do you want your drink: 0, 50, 100, 200?".

    4. Now check:

        1. If `sweetness` equals 50 print "half sweetened".

        2. Else if `sweetness` 100 print "normal sweet".

        3. Else if `sweetness` 200 print "super sweet".

        4. Else print with a string of "non-sweet".

    5. Then print the string of "Your order of " concatenated with the variable `beverage`, concatenated with " boba with a sweet level of ", concatenated with the variable `sweetness`

    6. Finally, print the string of "Goodbye".

3. Execute the Python program.

    1. Open your terminal/git bash.

    2. From within the terminal/git bash run `source activate PythonData`Â to activate your virtual environment.

    3. Navigate to the directory that is holding this code drill.

    4. Run `python variables-01.py` to test your output.
