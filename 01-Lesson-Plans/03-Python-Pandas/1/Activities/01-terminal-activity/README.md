# Getting Familiar with the Terminal #

In this activity, we're going to practice more terminal commands. 

1. Open the terminal in this folder.

2. Use the `ls` command to see the contents of this folder.

3. Use the `pwd` command to find the current path you're in.

    **Note:** The path you're currently in is the folder you right-clicked on to start Git Bash or Terminal. 

4. Make a new directory named `Activity-1`. Then, list the contents of the current directory again to make sure it worked.

5. Navigate into the directory you just created.

6. Create a file named `hello.md` and list the contents of the current directory again.

7. Copy this file to a file named `world.md`.

8. Rename the `hello.md` file to `coding.md`.

9. Make a new directory named `terminal`.

10. Move the `world.md` file into the `terminal` folder.

11. Delete the `terminal` folder.

You're done! Feel free to play around in the terminal to explore the commands provided in the cheat sheet. (You can find the cheat sheet in the Hints folder.)
