# Dictionaries and Bracket Notation

In this exercise, you are given two dictionaries. They are actually the same dictionary, except that one contains content, and the other doesn't. Your job will be to convert the dictionary without content into an exact replica of the dictionary that is commented out.

You may not create a new dictionary, but can instead only use bracket notation to populate the empty `san_francisco` dictionary; you will know you have completed the challenge when your print matches the commented out dictionary.

## Instructions

Perform the following

1. Re-create the content of the commented out `san_francisco` dictionary by using bracket notation to manually add each of the key-value pairs (including nested objects).

2. Print the manually modified `san_francisco` dictionary and confirm the contents match the commented out version.

## Hint

Using bracket notation with dictionaries to add key-value pairs looks like the following.

```san_francisco["west_coast"] = True```
