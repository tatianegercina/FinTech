# Programming Challenges

These challenges are meant to strengthen your all-around coding skills and thinking. Unlike past challenges, these do not focus on a single topic and are meant to be brainteasers.

Open `challenge.py` and follow the instructions for each problem, approaching them as you see fit. Have fun with this!

## Instructions

Open the [starter file](Unsolved/algo-challenge-01.py) and perform the following:

1. Import the `random` library.

2. Answer each question with the correct coding solution.

3. Execute the Python program.

    * Open the command line.

    * Run `source activate PythonData` to activate your virtual environment.

    * Navigate to the directory that is holding this code drill.

    * Run `python filename.py` to test your output.
