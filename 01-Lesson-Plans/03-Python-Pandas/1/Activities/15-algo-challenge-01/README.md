# Programming challenges

These challenges are meant to strengthen your all-around coding skills and thinking; unlike the past challenges, these do not focus on a single topic. They are meant to be brain teasers.

Approach these problems in the best way you see fit. Open challenge.py and follow the instructions for each problem within. Have fun!

## Instructions

Perform the following:

1. Import the `random` library.

2. Answer each question with the correct coding solution.

3. Execute the Python program.
