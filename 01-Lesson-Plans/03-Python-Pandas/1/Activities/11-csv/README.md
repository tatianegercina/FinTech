# CSV Practice

In this activity, you will import a CSV file and loop through its data. Put your trainer caps on, because we're going to be reading Pokemon data––all 807 pokemon to be exact!

This activity will provide additional practice in importing a CSV, reading its data, and searching the data for given paramaters using for loops and if statements.

If you get stuck, refer to the in-class activities (specifically, 07 and 08) for additional help.

**Hint:**  `str` and `int` types cannot be evaluated against each other and must be converted to be the same data type.
