# Password Strength Checker 

In this activity, you will create a validation function to check the strength of a password. The focus of this activity is the logic behind the checker, so you will be given the HTML and the rest of the JavaScript. You should not have to modify any part of the code given to you. Just work within the area allotted to you to fulfill the objectives.

Password strengths are defined as follows:

* A _very weak_ password contains 6 or fewer characters consisting only of numbers.

* A _very strong_ password has more than 6 characters consisting of at least one number and at least one letter.

* All other passwords are of average strength
