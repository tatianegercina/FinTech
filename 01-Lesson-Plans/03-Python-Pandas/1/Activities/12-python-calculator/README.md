# Making a Calculator 

This activity will combine everything we've covered today, along with some tools from yesterday. We're going to make a very basic arithmetic calculator that takes in user input and returns the result of the calculation. This is a challenging activity, so remember that there's always the Hints folder for you to lean on. 

Your calculator should only take numbers, `+`, `-`, `*`, and the `/` key as valid inputs.

It is highly recommended that you use functions to section out your logic and validate each user's input so that they are unable to add multiple operators.
