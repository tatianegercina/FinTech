# Using Bracket Notation

In this activity, you will populate a dictionary without hard-coding values into it.

You will be given two dictionaries. They are actually the same dictionary, but one contains content and the other does not. Your job is to convert the dictionary _without_ content into an exact replica of the dictionary that is commented out.

You may not create a new dictionary; use only bracket notation to populate the empty `san_francisco` dictionary.

You will know you have completed this activity when your print matches the commented-out dictionary.
