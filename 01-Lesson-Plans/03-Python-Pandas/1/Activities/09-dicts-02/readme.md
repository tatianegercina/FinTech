## Traversing Through Dictionaries

In this challenge, you are given a large dictionary `show_data.py`. Your job is to navigate through this dictionary and to answer the prompts via key-value pairs.

For example, who is the actor that plays Ned Stark in Game of Thrones (drama)?

Correct Answer: `shows["genre"]["drama"]["game_of_thrones"]["cast"][0]["actor"]`

## Instructions

1. Use the `from` keyword to import the `shows` dictionary from the `show_data.py` file

2. Answer each question by printing the expected result using bracket notation for the `show` dictionary.

## Hint

You may find that you're repeating yourself a lot. It may be helpful to create variables that point to different locations within the dictionary.

For example: `drama = shows["genre"]["drama"]`

Then to get the actor who plays Rick in Walking Dead, we would simply write `drama["the_walking_dead"]["cast"][0]["actor"]` as opposed to `shows["genre"]["drama"]["the_walking_dead"]["cast"][0]["actor"]`.
