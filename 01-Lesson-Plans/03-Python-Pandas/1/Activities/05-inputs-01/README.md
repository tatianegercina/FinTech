# User Prompts

You will be getting more practice declaring and manipulating variables, using conditionals, and requesting user input in this exercise.

## Instructions

Open the [starter file](Unsolved/inputs-01.py) and perform the following:

1. Declare a variable `welcome_name` as an input with a string of "Welcome to the sandwich shop, what do I call you?".

2. Then print the string "Hello" concatenated with the variable `welcome_name`.

3. Declare a variable `question_sandwich` as an input with a string of "Are you here for a sandwich?".

4. If `question_sandwich` is equal to true:

    1. Declare a variable `food_prompt` as an input with a string of "What kind of sandwich would you like?".

    2. Then print a string of "Please wait 10 min for your " concatenated with the variable `food_prompt`.

    3. If `question_sandwich` is false, print a string of "If you don't want a sandwich what are you here for?!".

5. Execute the Python program.

    1. Open your terminal / git bash

    2. From within terminal / git bash run `source activate PythonData` to activate your virtual environment.

    3. Navigate to the directory that is holding this code drill

    4. Run `python challenge-prompt.py` to test your output.
