# Making a Calculator

This activity is going to combine everything we've covered today along with some tools from yesterday. We're going to be making a very basic arithmetic calculator that takes in user input and returns the result of the calculation. This is a challenging activity, so remember that there's always the hints folder for you to lean on.

## Instructions

Open the [starter file](Unsolved/python-calculator-01.py) and perform the following:

1. Define a function `calculate` that takes in two numbers and adds, subtracts, multiplies, or divides the two numbers.

    1. Create a variable `result` and set it to 0.

    2. Prompt the user "What do you want to do: Add, Subtract, Multiply or Divide?" and assign the answer to a variable `choice`.

    3. Create an if-else statement to perform the proper calculation with the two parameters based on the user's `choice`.

    4. Return the calculated `result` variable.

2. Call the `calculate` function and print the results.

3. Execute the Python program.

    1. Open your terminal/git bash.

    2. From within the terminal/git bash run `source activate PythonData` to activate your virtual environment.

    3. Navigate to the directory that is holding this code drill.

    4. Run `python filename.py` to test your output.
