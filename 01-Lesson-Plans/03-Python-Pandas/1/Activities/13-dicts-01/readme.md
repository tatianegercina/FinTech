# Using Bracket Notation

## Populate a dictionary without hard-coding values into it

In this exercise, you are given two dictionarys. They are actually the same dictionary, except that one contains content, and the other doesn't. Your job will be to convert the dictionary without content into an exact replica of the dictionary that is commented out.

You may not create a new dictionary, but can instead only use bracket notation to populate the empty `san_francisco` dictionary.

You will know you have completed the challenge when your print matches the commented out dictionary.
