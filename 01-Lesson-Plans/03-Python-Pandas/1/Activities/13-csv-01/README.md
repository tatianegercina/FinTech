# CSV Practice

Put your trainer caps on because we're going to be reading Pokemon data. All 807 pokemon to be exact! In this exercise, you will import a csv file, read its data and search through the data for given parameters using for loops and if statements.

## Instructions

Open the [starter file](Unsolved/csv-01.py) and perform the following:

1. Import the necessary libraries for reading csv files

2. Set the path for the csv file

3. Create new lists to store data for heaviest and tallest pokemon

4. Open the csv

5. Iterate through the data and search for the number the user inputted. Remember to skip the header of the CSV.

6. Print the name of the pokemon(identifier) and pokedex number(species id) at that number. For example, "Pokemon No. 25 - pikachu".

7. Iterate through the data and search for pokemon whose weight is greater than 3000. Append only the pokemon's name and weight to the 'heaviest' list.

8. Iterate through the data and search for pokemon whose height is greater than 50. Append only the pokemon's name and height to the 'tallest' list.

9. Print the list of heaviest and tallest pokemon

10. Execute the Python program.

    1. Open your terminal/git bash.

    2. From within the terminal/git bash run `source activate PythonData` to activate your virtual environment.

    3. Navigate to the directory that is holding this code drill.

    4. Run `python filename.py` to test your output.

## Hints

Hint:  `str` and `int` types cannot be evaluated against each other and must be converted to be the same data type.
