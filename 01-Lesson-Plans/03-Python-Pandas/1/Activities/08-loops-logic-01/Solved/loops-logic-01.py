# declare a variable named our_list and assign an empty list to it


# we can `append` values into an list with the append method. Documentation can be found here:
# https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_list_append.asp

# Let's append the number 1 into our_list


# append the string "hello" into our_list


# append the boolean false into our_list


# append the number 84 into our_list


# append the string "world" into our list


# print our_list
