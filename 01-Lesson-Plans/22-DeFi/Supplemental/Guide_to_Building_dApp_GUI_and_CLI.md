# Guide to Building dApp GUIs and CLIs

This guide is a reference for building Graphical User Interfaces or Command Line Interfaces for Solidity dApps.


## Python

[Web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) can be used in [Jupyter Notebooks](Example_dApp/jupyter_notebook/accident.ipynb) to create a dynamic and shareable graphical interface for your dApp.

You can also create command-line interfaces with Python libraries like [Python-Fire](https://github.com/google/python-fire)

## Remix

[OneClickdApp](https://oneclickdapp.com/) allows you to build your smart contract to any network using Remix.

## Pinata and IPFS

[Pinata API/ IPFS Gateway](https://pinata.cloud/documentation) is a great resource for storing and serving files, such as images for a decentralized application. It allows you to access files from an s3 AWS bucket-style CDN.
