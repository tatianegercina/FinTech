## README

A good README file can help your Github repository stand apart. In this activity, you will analyze a sample of README files.

### Instructions

In this activity you will compare three README files.

* [Sample 1 README](Resources/sample_1/README.md)

* [Sample 2 README](Resources/sample_2/README.md)

* [Sample 3 README](Resources/sample_3/README.md)

* Start by opening `sample_1/README.md` and discuss with a partner what makes this a poor README.

  * What sections is it missing?

  * Would it be appealing to you as an employer?

* Then open `sample_2/README.md` and `sample_3/README.md`. Compare these to the first README file.

  * Which do you think is the better and why?

  * What does the better one do that the others do not?

  * What are the problems you note with the README that you didn't deem the "best"?

**NOTE:**  Github READMEs can always be improved on, so when creating a README, consider adding other features like animated images of your project, additional screenshots, and other details that may be important to someone viewing your project.
