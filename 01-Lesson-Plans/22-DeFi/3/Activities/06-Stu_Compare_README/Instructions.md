In this activity you will compare three README files.

- Start by opening `SAMPLE_1.md` and discuss with a partner what makes this a poor README

  - What sections is it missing?
  - Would it be appealing to you as an employer?

- Then open `SAMPLE_2.md` which is a better README than the first, as well as `SAMPLE_3.md`. Compare the second and first README files.
  - Which do you think is the better of the two, and why?
  - What does the better one do that the other does not?
  - What are the problems you note with the resume that you didn't deem the "best" of the two.

**NOTE:** Even the best of these READMEs could probably be improved upon. When you create a GitHub repository for a project, you can use these as a base, but feel free to add other features like interactive gifs of your app, additional screenshots and other details important to someone viewing your app.
