### 3. Students Do: Building the CryptoFax Car Token (20 min)

In this activity students will implement a non-fungible car token containing an immutable vehicle history using the ERC721 OpenZeppelin contract. This contract will require them to apply their knowledge of safemath counters, structs, and events.

**Instructions:**
