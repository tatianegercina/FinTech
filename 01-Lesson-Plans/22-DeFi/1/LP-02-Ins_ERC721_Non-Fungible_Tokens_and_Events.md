### 2. Instructor Do: ERC721 Non-Fungible Tokens and Events (15 min)

In this activity, the class will be reintroduced to the ERC721 standard, review fungible vs non-fungible, and demonstrate implementing ERC721 using OpenZeppelin. You will explain the concept of events in solidity and demonstrate defining new events (appraisal, etc.) and associating them with unique ERC721 tokens.
