## 22.1 Lesson Plan: DeFi (Decentralized Finance)

### Overview

In today's class, students will be introduced to the concept of DeFi short for decentralized finance. Though DeFi most commonly refers to financial systems built upon distributed ledgers frequently leveraging smart contracts. Students will gain the scope that DeFi is not a particular technology or implementation but rather a movement within the financial technology sector where future financial systems are being created and deployed with an open, decentralized, and permissionless architecture.

### Class Objectives

By the end of the unit, students will be able to:

* Build non-fungible ERC721 tokens with OpenZeppelin

* Explain what events are and how they can be used to create a dApp

* Use Filters in Web3.py to react to Events from smart contracts

### Instructor Notes

* The contracts you will be deploying today are relatively large and may take a few minutes to compile.

* Refer to OpenZeppelin ERC721 documentation for further information about Non-Fungible Tokens. [ERC721 Docs](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/token/erc721)

* Have your TAs keep track with the [Time Tracker](TimeTracker.xlsx)

### 1. Instructor Do: Welcome Back (10 min)

Previously students have implemented both a basic token as well as the ERC21 fungible token standard using the OpenZeppelin libraries. Today they will be implementing their first ERC721 Non-fungible token using the Openzeppelin libraries. Take a few minutes to review the concept of fungibility by discussing the following recall questions with the class.
