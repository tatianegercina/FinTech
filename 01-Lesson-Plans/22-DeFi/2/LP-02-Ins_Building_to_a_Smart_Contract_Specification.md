**Files:**

* [Solved - CryptoRight.sol](Activities/LP-02-Ins_Building_to_a_Smart_Contract_Specification/Solved/CryptoRight.sol)

* [Unsolved - CryptoRight.sol](Activities/LP-02-Ins_Building_to_a_Smart_Contract_Specification/Unsolved/CryptoRightSpec.sol)

* [Example CryptoRight EIP](Activities/LP-02-Ins_Building_to_a_Smart_Contract_Specification/Unsolved/ExampleEIP.md)

Begin by opening the [Example CryptoRight EIP](Activities/LP-02-Ins_Building_to_a_Smart_Contract_Specification/Unsolved/ExampleEIP.md) and displaying it for the class.

* In earlier classes we took a look at variety of the EIP specifications located on [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS)

* Today we will be taking a new example EIP, and are going to be breaking it down and translating it into functioning code.
