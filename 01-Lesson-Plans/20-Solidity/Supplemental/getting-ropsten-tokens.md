# Getting Ropsten Tokens

The Ropsten test network is intended to allow developers to test their applications using the Ethereum blockchain. To ask for test `ETH` tokens in this network, follow the next steps. It's is assumed that you have already installed the MetaMask plug-in in your web browser.

1. Open your browser and navigate to the `Ropsten` network faucet at https://faucet.ropsten.be/.

2. In the faucet home page, copy and paste your wallet address and click on the "Send me test ETH" button to continue.

3. If the transaction were successful, you would see the following confirmation message.

After a few minutes, you will receive at least `1 ETH` test token in your wallet.

We recommend you to get your test tokens before the class.
