### 18. Instructor Do: Recap (5 min)

Congratulate students to reach the end of the first day on smart contracts! Close the class by briefly reviewing the main concepts of the day, Smart Contracts and dApps.

Ask students to provide a definition of a smart contract and a dApp and then provide the following definitions:

* Smart contracts are computer programs that allow credible transactions of digital assets under certain conditions without third parties.

* A dApp is a software that has a decentralized operation and uses a decentralized storage or database.

* In general terms, a smart contract is a decentralized application that can run on a blockchain.

Explain to students that we will begin to learn how to program smart contracts in Ethereum using the Solidity programming language.

By the end of this unit, students will be writing their custom smart contracts and dApps for Ethereum!
