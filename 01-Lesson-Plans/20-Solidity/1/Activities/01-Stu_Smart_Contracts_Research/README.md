# Smart Contracts in Action

In this activity, you will examine several smart contract use cases and curate a list of features for each.

## Instructions

1. Get into a group of three people.

2. Each group should pick a use case to read for a few minutes.

3. Every member of the group should read the use case and make a list of the different features and functionality that they notice.

4. Discuss the different features and functionalities that were identified by each member of the group, and compare them with the features that dApps should comply according to ["The General Theory of Decentralized Applications"](https://github.com/DavidJohnstonCEO/DecentralizedApplications):

   * Decentralized operation: open-source code, autonomous operation, consensus of its users.

   * Decentralized storage: storage on a blockchain, cryptographically sealed.

   * Cryptographic cryptocurrency: use of tokens for access and value contribution.

   * Token generation: tokens as proof of value, generated through a cryptographic algorithm.

5. Try to come up with a core set of features that you may share with the class.

## Use Cases

* [0x - The protocol for trading tokens](https://0x.org/)

* [Chainlink - Your smart contracts connected to real-world data, events, and payments](https://chain.link/)

* [My Crypto Heroes - Hero worker-placement RPG](https://www.mycryptoheroes.net/)

* [CryptoDozer - Decentralized Gaming with Meta-Blockchain](https://cryptodozer.io/)

* [BasicAttentionToken - Blockchain-based digital advertising](https://basicattentiontoken.org/)

* [ubex - Artificial intelligence in advertising](https://www.ubex.com/)

* [status - Open source, secure & private messenger, crypto wallet, and web3 browser](https://status.im/)

* [Cent - The income-generating social network](https://beta.cent.co/)

* [HireGo - Reinventing shared mobility using blockchain, smart contracts, and A.I.](https://www.hirego.io/)

* [CryptoMotors - Digital Automaker powered by the Ethereum Blockchain](https://www.cryptomotors.io/)

## Hints

* Think big, It's OK to point out socioeconomic features in addition to technical ones.

* Try to imagine the implications of these use cases on society.
