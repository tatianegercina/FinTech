# Setting Up Remix and Ganache

In this activity, you will be configuring your development environment for writing and deploying smart contracts on your local development blockchain.

## Instructions

* Install and configure Ganache following the [Unit 20 Installation Guide](../../../Supplemental/unit-20-install-guide.md).

* Once you've completed the setup, take a moment to explore Ganache.

* Next, open the Remix IDE at [remix.ethereum.org](https://remix.ethereum.org) and use your remaining time exploring Remix by performing the following actions:

    * Enable the `Solidity` development environment by clicking on the "Solidity" button on the Remix Home tab.

    * Create a new smart contract by clicking the Add local file button. Then, populate the contents with [MessageBoard.sol](Resources/MessageBoard.sol).

    * The Solidity file's code should appear in the editor window.

    * Click the Solidity Compiler button on the Remix sidebar then click Compile to compile the contract.

    * Now click the Deploy tab on the Remix sidebar.

    * Open MetaMask (MetaMask may prompt you to sign-in), then select localhost:8545 from the dropdown menu at the top.

    * Back in Remix, change the Environment to Injected Web3. 
      
        * Once Injected Web3 is selected, it should connect to a Custom network (this is Ganache). 
        
        * When you connect to the Custom network, you may be asked to reload the page and then recompile the contract.

        * Finally, click the deploy button and confirm the transaction in Remix.

Great job! It may look complicated now, but soon all of these steps will make perfect sense. You'll soon be navigating both Ganache and Remix with ease!
