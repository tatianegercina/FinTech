In this activity, you will work in groups of up to three people to research any particular dApps from your groups' interests.

The goal of this activity is to get familiarized with the diversity of dApps that currently exists in the Ethereum ecosystem.

2. Open your browser and navigate to The State Of The Dapps website (https://www.stateofthedapps.com/) and have the group decide which category (or sector) you are going to research. Break the mold and try to explore some categories beyond the finance sector.

3. You are encouraged to research among those dApps that are based on Ethereum but feel free to explore other blockchain networks.

4. Each member of the group should spend a few minutes to explore the dApps on the selected category and look for a dApps that could be interesting to share with the class.

 * What is the status of this dApp?

 * What blockchain network(s) does the dApp use?

 * Is it possible to use MetaMask to interact with the dApps?

 * How does the dApp disrupt the traditional market in its sector?
