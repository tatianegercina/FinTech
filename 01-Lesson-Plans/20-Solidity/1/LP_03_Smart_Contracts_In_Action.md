### 3. Student Do: Smart Contracts in Action (15 min)

In this activity, students will work in groups up to three people to analyze several use cases to explore that correspond with popular types of smart contracts like tokens, notaries, supply chain, digital marketplaces, etc.

Circulate through the room while students are completing the activity. Look to identify students who are actively engaging peers and digging deeper. Keep these students in mind for later, as they may be helpful to distribute among groups.

If students are actively engaged with each other and the research process, they are succeeding at this exercise.

The only way to not excel at this exercise is to not participate in the research.

### 4. Instructor Do: Smart Contracts in Action Review (5 min)

Conduct a facilitated discussion by asking a couple of groups to share their conclusions and insights about the use cases their review, focus on discussing with the class which features they noticed are compliant with the criteria from ["The General Theory of Decentralized Applications"](https://github.com/DavidJohnstonCEO/DecentralizedApplications).

* Decentralized operation: open-source code, autonomous operation, consensus of its users.

* Decentralized storage: storage on a blockchain, cryptographically sealed.

* Cryptographic cryptocurrency: use of tokens for access and value contribution.

* Token generation: tokens as proof of value, generated through a cryptographic algorithm.

Have groups share a few items on the lists of features they curated, answer any questions before moving on.
