### 3. Student Do: Smart Contracts in Action (15 mins)

In this activity, students will analyze several use cases to explore that correspond with popular types of smart contracts like tokens, notaries, supply chain, digital marketplaces, etc.

Circulate through the room while students are completing the activity. Look to identify students who are actively engaging peers and digging deeper. Keep these students in mind for later, as they may be helpful to distribute among groups.

If students are actively engaged with each other and the research process, they are succeeding at this exercise.

The only way to not excel at this exercise is to not participate in the research.
