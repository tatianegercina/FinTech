### 10. Students Do: Contextualizing Solidity Worksheet (10 min)

Students will fill in a simple chart (pipeline) of the various levels of the EVM's architecture with the names of the various levels and their real-world implementation.

**Instructions:**

* [README.md](Activities/10_Stu_Contextualizing_Solidity_Worksheet/README.md)

**Files:**

* [WorkSheet - Solved](Activities/10_Stu_Contextualizing_Solidity_Worksheet/Solved/evm_worksheet.md)

* [WorkSheet - Unsolved](Activities/10_Stu_Contextualizing_Solidity_Worksheet/Unsolved/evm_worksheet.md)

### 11. Instructor Do: Contextualizing Solidity Review (5 min)

Once again, display the completed graphic of the EVM's architecture to the class.

Ask the class the following recall questions:

* What is a potential benefit of executing code in a virtual machine?

  **Answer** The code executed in a virtual machine cannot affect the host machine directly.

  **Answer** The code can run anywhere the virtual machine can run.

* What do you think some benefits of Solidity being a compiled language might be?

  **Answer** Human readable code can turn into machine-readable code.

  **Answer** Code can be executed faster.

* What's an example of a programing language that humans write, eg `High level languages`?

  **Answer** Solidity

  **Answer** C++

  **Answer** Java
