### 10. Students Do: Contextualizing Solidity Worksheet (10 min)

Students will fill in a simple chart (pipeline) of the various levels of the EVM's architecture with the names of the various levels and their real-world implementation.

**Instructions:**

Ask the class the following recall questions:

* What is a potential benefit of executing code in a virtual machine?

  **Answer** The code executed in a virtual machine cannot affect the host machine directly.

  **Answer** The code can run anywhere the virtual machine can run.

* What do you think some benefits of Solidity being a compiled language might be?

  **Answer** Human readable code can turn into machine readable code.

  **Answer** Code can just be executed faster.

* What's a basic component of a virtual machine?

   **Answer** CPU, program counter, or stack.

* What is an example of a `Higher Level Language`?

  **Answer** Solidity

  **Answer** C++

  **Answer** Java
