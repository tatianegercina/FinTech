### 4. Everyone Do: Installing MetaMask (10 min)

In this activity, the instructor will have the class installing the [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) browser extension, and import their mnemonics to enable dApp support on their web browsers.

Open the lesson slides, move to the "Installing MetaMask" section, and highlight the following:

* MetaMask is a web browser extension that allows you to run an Ethereum decentralized application (dApp) right in your browser without running a full Ethereum node.

* We are going to use MetaMask to run our dApps and make transfers to our blockchains.

Slack out the MetaMask web address to students (https://metamask.io/), open the URL in your browser and ask students to follow you along the installation process.

Explain to students that since MetaMask is a web browser extension, it will run seamlessly in any operating system.

* When you navigate to the MetaMask's URL, your browser will be automatically detected, if not, choose the correct version.

* The Google Chrome extension is going to be used in this demo.

Click on the "Get Chrome Extension" link, a new window is going to be opened where you will be able to install the MetaMask extension from the Chrome Web Store.

Click on the "Add to Chrome" button to start the installation process.

Next a pop-up window will be opened where you have to click on the "Add Extension" button to continue.

When the "Welcome to MetaMask" website opens, explain to students that they should see a small "fox icon" in the toolbar if MetaMask was successfully installed in their web browsers.

To start configuring your MetaMask account, click on the "Get Started" button.

Explain to students that we will import the wallet that runs in our local blockchain.

Click on the "Import Wallet" button to continue.

Explain the following points about the usage agreement:

* The usage agreement is where the MetaMask team asks you to collaborate on improving the tool.

* This agreement to participate is optional and is a personal choice.

In the next window, explain to students that they should enter the twelve words mnemonic of their local wallet, their wallet password, and they should click on the "I have read and agree the Terms of Use" checkbox to continue.

Explain to students that we can securely accept the "Terms of Use" from MetaMask. If any student has a concern, invite him or her to read through the terms by clicking on the link.

After filling out your wallet details, click on the "Import" button to continue, and you will see the following confirmation page.

Students may notice a message at the bottom of the page that says that `MetaMask cannot recover your seedphrase`. Explain to students that this means that once you import your keys, MetaMask won't export them again, so if you lose your mnemonic you can't extract it from metamask. Encourage students to keep their mnemonics in a safe place!

Click on the "All Done" button to continue. Explain to students that they will see a page showing the balance of their wallet and the transaction history.

Explain to students that they may have `0 ETH` and no transactions. Explain to students that this is all right from now since we have not started our local blockchain. We will learn how to connect MetaMask with our local wallet in the future activities.

Explain the following about the wallet keys:

* In Ethereum, the same keys can be used across any Ethereum network.

* Addresses can have difference balances on each of these networks.

* Regardless of the network (i.e. main net, Kovan, Ropsten, or a local blockchain), all of these networks use the same addresses and keys.

Congratulate students on getting started with their first dApp!

Answer any questions before moving on.
