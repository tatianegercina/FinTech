### 2. Instructor Do: Introduction to Smart Contracts and dApps (10 min)

In this activity, students will learn more about smart contracts, and they will be introduced to the concept of decentralized applications (dApps).

Open the lesson slides and conduct a facilitated discussion by starting with the following question:

* If smart contracts are computer programs that allow credible transactions of digital assets under certain conditions without third parties, what could be the building blocks to define and deploy smart contracts?

If nobody answers the question, lean on blockchain enthusiasts in the class to start the discussion by asking the question directly to one of them.

Spend up to three minutes in this initial question, and use the classroom board to create a list of the building blocks shared by the students. Summarize the answers with the following list and explain each bullet.

* A reliable and robust blockchain technology.

  * **Explanation:** We will use Ethereum in this class, a platform that not only offers a cryptocurrency but also, it is a blockchain-based distributed computing platform featuring smart contract functionality and applications development.

* A robust and reliable programming language.

  * **Explanation:** Along the following weeks, we will use Solidity, one of the best programming languages to create and deploy smart contracts in Ethereum.

* An isolated execution environment.

  * **Explanation:** We will use the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), a powerful, sand-boxed virtual stack embedded within each full Ethereum node.

* Robust encryption mechanisms.

  * **Explanation:** As we learned in the previous units, Ethereum uses public and private keys encryption mechanisms to ensure the confidentiality of the data transmitted in the blockchain.

* An industry-supported blockchain technology.

  * **Explanation:** Beside the [Ethereum Foundation](https://www.ethereum.org/), who is in charge of the development of the Ethereum framework, several companies also support Ethereum through [the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA)](https://entethalliance.org/). Various blockchain start-ups, research groups, and Fortune 500 companies form this association ([full list of members](https://entethalliance.org/members/)).

* A suitable set of development tools to create and deploy smart contracts.

  * **Explanation:** As part of the Ethereum development toolbox, we have software tools like Remix, Truffle, and Ganache, that help developers to comfortably and confidently create, compile, and deploy smart contracts. These are the tools we are going to use in this Unit.

Continue in the lesson slides, move the "Decentralized Applications" section and highlight the following:

* At a glance, a **decentralized application or dApp** is a software that has a decentralized operation and uses a decentralized storage or database.

* In contrast to traditional software applications that generally run in a centralized server and use a central storage or database, dApps run in a decentralized environment that is provided by the nodes in the blockchain.

* The concept of dApps was formally presented in 2015 by David Johnston, _et al._ in a white paper entitled ["The General Theory of Decentralized Applications, Dapps"](https://github.com/DavidJohnstonCEO/DecentralizedApplications) where the authors defined the criteria that dApps should comply:

  * Decentralized operation: open-source code, autonomous operation, consensus of its users.

  * Decentralized storage: storage on a blockchain, cryptographically sealed.

  * Cryptographic cryptocurrency: use of tokens for access and value contribution.

  * Token generation: tokens as proof of value, generated through a cryptographic algorithm.

* Using dApps, we can develop software applications not only for the financial sector but also web browsers, cloud storage, instant messaging, social networks, and even operating systems.

Explain to students that this new paradigm of software development is also known as version 3 of the Internet or Web 3.0. Web 1.0 was the beginning of the Internet were websites were very simple with limited interactivity and the basic tools and protocols were defined; Web 2.0 was marked by the raise of social networks and cloud computers, the new Web 3.0 is the evolution of the Internet to a decentralized environment powered by blockchain technologies.

Comment to students that in the following weeks, they will learn how to create and deploy dApps using the Ethereum platform.

Answer any questions before moving on.
