### 17. Instructor Do: Homework Demo (5 mins)

In this activity, students will get a big-picture idea about unit homework.

**Files:**

* [README.md](../../../02-Homework/20-Solidity/Instructions/README.md)

Open the Unit 20 homework assignment instructions, briefly demo the homework solution to students, and highlight the following:

* The goal of this homework assignment is to allow students to define, create, and deploy a smart contract using a dApps and MetaMask to interact with the contract operations.

* Students will create an identity smart contract that will be deployed as a dApp using GitHub pages.

* As starter code, students will have a small frontend that will interact with their contract when they successfully implement the proper functions and variables.

* Students will test their dApps locally, and also, by deploying their solution to a test net.

Explain to students that this will be an excellent opportunity to gain hands-on experience in creating and deploying smart contracts using Solidity.

Answer any questions before moving on.
