### 17. Instructor Do: Homework Demo (5 mins)

In this activity, students will get a big-picture overview of the homework.

**Files:**

* [README.md](../../../02-Homework/20-Solidity/Instructions/README.md)

Open the Unit 20 homework assignment instruction and briefly demo the homework instructions for students. Be sure to highlight the following:

* The goal of this homework assignment is to use Solidity to define, create, and deploy a smart contract dApp. MetaMask will be used to interact with the contract operations.

* The identity smart contract will be deployed as a dApp using GitHub pages.

* Starter code is provided that includes a small frontend that can be used to interact with the contract.

* Students will test their dApps locally, and also, by deploying their solution to a test net.

Explain to students that this will be an excellent opportunity to gain hands-on experience in creating and deploying smart contracts using Solidity.

Answer any questions before moving on.
