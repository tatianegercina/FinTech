# Solidity Instructor Resources

Solidity is a smart contract programming language that runs on many blockchains, namely, Ethereum (EVM) compatible chains.

It is heavily inspired by Javascript, C++, and Python.

The [Solidity Documentation](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) provides fantastic resources that walk through
what the language is for, and how it works.

This [Solidity By Example collection](https://github.com/raineorshine/solidity-by-example) provides short and sweet
smart contract examples that allow for quick learning of the language.

We recommend following the [CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io/) interactive tutorial to get in-depth practice that
should bootstrap your Solidity skills quickly, especially if you are familiar with other programming languages.
