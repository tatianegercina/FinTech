# Getting Ropsten Tokens

The Ropsten test network is intended to allow developers to test their applications using the Ethereum blockchain. To ask for test `ETH` tokens in this network, follow the next steps. It's is assumed that you have already installed the MetaMask plug-in in your web browser.

1. Open your browser and navigate to the `Ropsten` network faucet at https://faucet.ropsten.be/.

2. In the faucet home page, copy and paste your wallet address and click on the "Send me test ETH" button to continue.

3. If the transaction were successful, you would see the following confirmation message.

After a few minutes, you will receive at least `1 ETH` test token in your wallet.

We recommend you to get your test tokens before the class.

## Troubleshooting

Depending on the Ropsten network status, you can be greylisted for a particular time.

If this happens you may opt for any of the following solutions:

1. Wait for the graylisted time to expired before asking for a test `ETH`.

2. Use a different wallet address.

3. You can use a wallet we have created for instructors in case you need it, add the wallet to MetaMask using the following mnemonic phrase: `invest pool ribbon damage balance once digital oil lucky utility session tuition`.

The instructors' wallet usually will have enough test `ETH` to run the activities in Unit 20. Please report any missing founds to the FinTech Curriculum Team in the `#05-fintech` channel in Slack.

**Important note:** Please avoid to share this wallet to students.
