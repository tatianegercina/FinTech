## 20.4 Lesson Plan: Solidity Review Day

### Overview

Today's class is an opportunity for students to review and practice fundamental programming skills in Solidity through a series of code drills.

### Instructor Notes

* Today's class will consist of Solidity code drills and review activities.

* Due to the difference between Python and Solidity, Today's class is an excellent opportunity to encourage students to consolidate their skills working with a compiled and strongly typed programming language like Solidity.

* Code drills range in complexity and pace, so the time allotted to each section of activities should be fluid to allow each student to work through the problems at their own pace.

* You may find it helpful to review specific drills or activities with the entire class, but the majority of the time will likely be best served by rotating between groups of students to help them with any issues that they are having. This will also be a good time to see how they are feeling about Solidity in general and to give them some words of encouragement.

* One way to challenge students is to have "code drill races," where students pair off and race each other to complete a set of drills. However, use this strategy cautiously and thoughtfully so that you don't overwhelm any beginner programmers.

* Overall, this should be a fun day for students that will help them build confidence in their Solidity programming skills. Be sure to offer plenty of support and encouragement to those students who have never worked with a compiled language.

### 1. Instructor Do: Welcome Students (5 min)

Welcome students and explain that Today's class will be a fun Solidity review day. Every student will get the opportunity to work with the instructional staff to answer any Solidity questions they have. Still, the majority of time will be spent working through a series of Solidity code drills.

Explain code drills to students:

* Solidity introduces a new programming paradigm that may be challenging to master. The good news is that we are going to continue working with Solidity in the forthcoming weeks.

* The most successful path to mastering anything is to practice, Today's class will offer the opportunity to strengthen the Solidity basics through a series of code drills that varies in complexity and are aimed to prepare you for the next weeks.

* The key to learning to code is _to code_. Building steady daily coding habits will help build muscle memory that makes the process of typing code and remembering syntax easier.

* The goal is to practice coding in Solidity to the point where all of the syntax of the language becomes second nature. This allows you to use your mental power on problem-solving and not on basic things like how to declare a variable or define a contract.

* Code drills are a way to help build that muscle memory. They are designed to provide essential practice with coding. The problems range from simple to complex, and they force you to focus on the fundamentals of the language.

Tell students that while they will be given all code drills at once, they should work through them at their own pace. Meanwhile, you and the TAs will be circulating the classroom to oversee students' work and answer any questions they have.

Encourage students to try to complete the simple code drills from memory, googling answers as needed.

### 2. Student Do: Code Drills (Remaining Class Time)

Students will be given the remaining class time to work through the code drills at their own pace.
