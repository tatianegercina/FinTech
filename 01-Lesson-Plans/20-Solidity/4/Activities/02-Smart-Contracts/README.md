# Building Basic Smart Contracts

In this activity, you will practice smart contracts' creation in Solidity.

## Instructions

Open [Remix](http://remix.ethereum.org/), import the [starter file](Unsolved/smart_contracts.sol) and perform the following code drills. Once you finish, compile the file to ensure the code works.

1. Create a contract called `MessageContract` that contains:

    * An Ethereum address variable `my_address` with a valid Ethereum address assigned to it.

    * A string variable `message` with a greeting salutation assigned to it.

2. Create a contract called `PersonalSavings` than contains:

    * A public payable address variable called `public_savings` with a valid Ethereum address assigned to it.

    * An address variable called `private_savings` with a valid address assigned to it.

    * A string variable called `account_holder` with your name assigned to it.

3. Create a contract called `VotingSystem` that contains:


    * A public address variable `chair`.

    * An address variable `last_voter`.

    * A positive integer variable `num_votes` with an initial value of zero.
