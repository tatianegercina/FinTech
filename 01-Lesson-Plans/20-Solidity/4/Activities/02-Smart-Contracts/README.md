# Building Smart Contracts

In this activity, you will practice smart contracts' creation in Solidity.

## Instructions

Open [Remix](http://remix.ethereum.org/), import the [starter file](Unsolved/smart-contracts.sol) and perform the following code drills. Once you finish, compile the file to ensure the code works.

1. Create a contract called `MessageContract` that contains an Ethereum address variable `my_address` and a string variable `message`. Set a valid address to `my_address` and a greeting message to `message`
