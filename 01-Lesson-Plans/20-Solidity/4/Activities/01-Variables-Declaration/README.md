# Variables Declarations and Basic Operations

In this activity, you will practice strong typing, variables declarations, and basic math and assignation operations in Solidity.

## Instructions

Open [Remix](http://remix.ethereum.org/), import the [starter file](Unsolved/variables-declaration.sol) and perform the following code drills. Once you finish, compile the file to ensure the code works.

1. Create an unsigned integer named `balance`.

2. Create a signed integer called `x`.

3. Define and assign an integer named `y` that has the value `2000`.

4. Create a constant `256 bit` integer `z` with an initial value of `3000`.

5. Create a `32 bit` integer named `mask` with an initial value of `0`.

6. Create a `256 bit` integer `default_mask` and assign a value of `4`.

7. Create a new `256 bit` integer named `a` and assign it the value of `x` times `y`.

8. Create a new public `256 bit` integer variable named `b` that has the initial value of `a` plus `z`.

9. Assign `x` the value of `1000`.

10. Create a `32 bit` integer variable named `c`.

11. Assign `c` the value of `mask` times `5`.

12. Create an unsigned `256 bit` integer named  `d` and assign it an initial value of `1`.

13. Create an address variable named `owner`.

14. Assign a valid Ethereum address to `owner`.

15. Create an in-memory string variable called `account_owner` and assign it to your name.

16. Create an in-memory string called `beneficiary_name` and assign it to the name of the person next to you.

17. Create a payable address variable called `main_account` and assign it a valid Ethereum address.

18. Create a boolean variable called `has_funds` and assign it the value of `true`.

19. Increment the value of `x` in one unit using a shorthand operator.

20. Decrement the value of 'y' in five units using a shorthand operator.
