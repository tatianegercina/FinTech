# Adding a Constructor to the Contract

In this activity, you will remove hardcoded values and replace them with a constructor function,
allowing for reusable code and better code style.

## Instructions

* Add a `constructor` function just below the variable definitions. Make sure it is set to public!

* In the `constructor` parameters, add two `payable` addresses.

* In the body of the `constructor`, set `account_one` and `account_two` to equal the respective parameters.

* Remove the hardcoded address value from the account owner variables, but keep the variable definitions like the others!
