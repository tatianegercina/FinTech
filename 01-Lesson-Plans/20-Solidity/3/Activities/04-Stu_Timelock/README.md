# Creating a Timelock in Solidity

In this activity, you will add a `require` and a timelock calculation to your `JointSavings.sol` contract
that will lock the contract for 24 hours after withdrawing.

## Instructions

* Add a new variable called `unlock_time` -- this will be a `uint` type.

* In the `withdraw` function, add a `require` that checks if `unlock_time < now` and returns the error "Account locked!" when the condition is not met.

* Right before the `msg.sender.transfer` call at the end of the `withdraw` function, update the `unlock_time` to `now + 24 hours;`

* For this contract, add the ability to test the timelock functionality by adding a new variable called `uint fakenow = now;` at the top of the contract, then replace every other instance of `now` with `fakenow`.

* Add this function to "fast forward" time by 100 days when the contract is deployed (requires setting up `fakenow`):

  ```solidity
  function fastforward() public {
      fakenow += 100 days;
  }
  ```

* Voila! Congratulate yourself on learning how to work with rudimentary time calculations in the native Solidity syntax!

## Hints
