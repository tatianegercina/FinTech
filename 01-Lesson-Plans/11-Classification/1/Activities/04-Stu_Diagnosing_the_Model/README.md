## Diagnose the Model

In a previous activity, you created a logistic regression model to predict whether or not someone as diabetes. Now its time to evaluate that model and determine whether or not it is accurate and precise with an acceptable rate of false positives and false negatives. Using the `confusion_matrix` and `classification_report` functions provided by **sklearn**, evaluate the model and determine whether or not it is "healthy" and providing accurate and precise predictions.

### Instructions

1. Generate the confusion matrix for the test data predictions.

2. Generate the classification report for the test data.

3. Interpret the results.

If time remains, discuss the results with a partner. How "good" is your predictor? Be prepared to share your model's "diagnosis" (the evaluation results) with the class!
