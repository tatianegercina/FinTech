## Diagnose the Model

In this activity, you will evaluate your diabetes predictor using a confusion matrix and classification report.

### Instructions

1. Generate the confusion matrix for the test data predictions.
2. Generate the classification report for the test data.

After completing the code, discuss the results with a partner. How "good" is your predictor? Be prepared to share your model's "diagnosis" (the evaluation results) with the class!
