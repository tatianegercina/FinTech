Open the solution and answer any questions that students have.

Facilitate a discussion around model evaluation using the following questions:

> How well did your model perform?
>
> How do you know? Did you count the results?
>
> If you were asked to diagnose a patient, how confident would you be in your model's prediction?

Explain to students that in addition to the accuracy score, there are other metrics that we can use for model evaluation such as precision and recall.
