### 1. Instructor Do: Intro to Classification (0:05)

Students will receive a brief, introductory lecture outlining what **classification** is and what it is used for.

**Files:**

* [Slides]()

Kick off the activity by asking for a student to try summarizing what **classification** is. If there are no volunteers, ask a specific student.

* **Answer** **Classification** is the prediction of discrete outcomes. Outcomes are identified as labels, which serve to categorize bi-class and multi-class features.

* Promote student confidence and engagement by thanking the student for volunteering the summary and emphasizing the parts of the answer that are correct. Use the student's answer as a transition into formal lecture.

Navigate to the 11.1 slides, and walk through the content on the slide:

* Provide students with the official definition of **classification**, as described by the Oxford English dictionary:

  > The action or process of classifying something according to shared qualities or characteristics

* Explain to students that in the scope of machine learning, the act of **classification** takes place through a process of supervised learning, where an algorithm is used that enables an application to analyze historical data sets and learn from the data in order to predict categorical membership and future outcomes.

* Underscore to students that there are a number of libraries available that make **classification** as easy as data cleaning. All that is needed is a series of calls to several functions. Assure students that training and running a **classification** model is as simple as:

  1. Prepping and wrangling their data sets (used to train and fit models)

  2. Using machine learning libraries and functions that are already available

If time remains, let students know there's time for one question.

* If there's a question, answer it, and then move onto the next activity. Assure students that the upcoming activities will shed more light on **classification** and that there will be additional time for questions.
