## 11.1 Lesson Plan: Classical Classification

### Overview

In the last unit, students learned how to use advanced statistical models and algorithms in order to predict and forecast outcomes using time series data. Students used statistical approaches; such as linear regression, **Hodrick-Prescott filter**, and **GARCH** and **EGARCH** model; to forecast investment returns, volatility, and out-of-sample predictions.

In unit 11, students will dive deeper into statistics and machine learning by working with **classification** algorithms in order to promote and enable supervised machined learning. **Classification** is the act of discovering whether or not a particular feature or element belongs to a given feature class; **classification** derives categorical conclusions based off of classified/modeled data. By the end of this unit, students will be competent in the execution and evaluation of **classification** models (i.e logistic regression and decision trees) for drawing categorical conclusions and outcomes.

Today's class will introduce students to **classification** models by explaining what classification is and delineating the various classification models/approaches. Then, students will be taught how to use Scikit-learn to train models and make them more efficient and effective in determining probability/outcome predictions.

Before students leave at the end of the class, encourage them to continue independently researching and learning more about the various ways to implement classification models, especially some of the ones not demonstrated in class (i.e. Nearest Neighbor).

### Class Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

### Instructor Notes

* Today's class will be a great deal of hands on work training and evaluating classification models. Because the content will be heavy in statistics and machine learning, it's important that you remind students of value and application of these skills/concepts to **FinTech**. Whenever appropriate, remind students that **classification** models enables financial companies to make faster and smarter data driven decisions and outcomes (i.e. credit risk and worthiness, money laundering and fraud identification, longevity and return for a particular investment, and loan recommendations).

* The world of **classification** is a large one. All forms and concepts of classification cannot be covered in one class. Ensure to pace the class and be cognizant of how long it takes to explain concepts. The key is to stay rooted in real world and practical examples of how classification can be used. Avoid getting bogged down in the statistical and mathematical detail for the algorithms. Focus should be placed on

  * What the algorithm/model is

  * What the algorithm/model does and Fintech use case

  * How it to train/enhance the algorithm/model

* Be sure to set the pace for the class. Encourage students to attend office hours if they feel lost or stuck. You might find that some students need additional assistance with the statistical concepts, and other students might need help with the application of machine learning models.

  * Encourage students to work with partners for all assignments in order to promote collaborative information seeking.

  * Remind students that additional research and practice will be required outside of class in order to reinforce and build competence in learning and evaluating trained models.

* Have your TAs keep track with the [Time Tracker](TimeTracker.xlsx)

### 1. Instructor Do: Welcome (10 min)

The instructor starts class with an introduction to **classification** and its use cases within FinTech. Students will receive the who, what, when, why, and how of FinTech **classification**.

**Files:**

* [Welcome Slides]()

Begin the class by welcome students back to the second week of machine learning!

* Explain to students that Unit 11 kicks off the second week of machine learning and advanced analytics. Highlight that this unit will focus on using machine learning algorithms and pipelines to draw conclusions and predictions about probable financial outcomes.

* Briefly explain what **classification** is. Indicate that **classification** is used to draw categorical conclusions about data. Instead of forecasting quantitative numbers, **classification** uses a binary approach to predict categorical membership.

  * Communicate that **classification** models can be used to identify a loan applicant as credit worthy or a credit risk.
