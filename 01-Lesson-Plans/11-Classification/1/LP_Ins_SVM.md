### 15. Instructor Do: Support Vector Machines (10 mins)

Students receive a demonstration and lecture on how to use support vector machines to create the same loan approver seen in the previous activity. However, instead of using a Logistic Regression approach, the instructor will show students how to classify loan eligibility using the support vector machines algorithm.

The goal of this activity is to illustrate to students the different approaches that can be taken to come up with the same classification engine. Another objective is to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm so students can learn how to identify the best approach based off of use case.
