### 3. Students Do: Predicting Diabetes (15 mins)

In this activity, students will use the **sklearn** library to execute **logistic regression** models in order to predict whether or not an individual has diabetes. Students will leverage the material covered in the corresponding instructor demo activity to complete this MSMD activity.

**Instructions:**

* [README.md](Activities/02-Stu_Diabetes/README.md)

**Files:**

* [diabetes_lr.ipynb](Activities/02-Stu_Diabetes/Unsolved/diabetes_lr.ipynb)

### 4. Instructor Do: Predicting Diabetes Activity Review (10 mins)

**Files:**

* [diabetes_lr.ipynb](Activities/02-Stu_Diabetes/Solved/diabetes_lr.ipynb)

Open the solution and answer any questions that students have.

Facilitate a discussion around model evaluation using the following questions:

> How well did your model perform?
>
> How do you know? Did you count the results?
>
> If you were asked to diagnose a patient, how confident would you be in your model's prediction?

Explain to students that in addition to the accuracy score, there are other metrics that we can use for model evaluation such as precision and recall.
