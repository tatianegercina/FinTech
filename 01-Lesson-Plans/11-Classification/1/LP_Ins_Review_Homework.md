### 2. Instructor Do: Review Homework (10 mins)

Students will receive a brief demonstration of the Unit 11 homework. The first half of this activity should be dedicated to giving a 5 minute overview. The second half should be to answer one or two questions.

**Homework Instructions:** [README.md](../../../02-Homework/11-Machine-Learning/Instructions/README.md)

Open the homework instructions, and provide a brief dry walk through of the instructions.

* Reveal that this week's homework focuses on creating a classification model focused on predicting and categorizing credit risk.

* Multiple models will be used for this assignment (i.e linear regression and decision trees). Explain to students that these models will be made available with the `Scikit-Learn` package, which was also used in Unit 10.

* Underscore to students that the goal behind the assignment is two fold:

  * Create a classification model that will categorize credit risk

  * Compare and contrast the various machine learning models that can be used to classify credit risk (i.e. resampling vs. ensemble learning). Each model used in the homework can essentially be used to come up with the same prediction: the goal is to identify which model is more accurate and precise.

* Explain that data for this activity will be from the **Lending Club**, a service that allows users to participate in peer-to-peer lending. **Lending club** has a great wealth of loan performance data that can be used to train machine learning algorithms for **classification**. The homework will include using data points such as loan amount, interest rate, loan balance, etc to make predictions about credit risk.

* Note to students that this homework will use the `imbalanced-learn` and `scikit-learn` tools. These tools need to be properly installed and functional.

End the activity by opening the floor for students to ask questions about the homework. Dedicate the next 5 minutes to answering these questions.
