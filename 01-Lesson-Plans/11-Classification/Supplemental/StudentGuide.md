* Finance and Machine Learning
  *  An [interview](https://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/will-machine-learning-transform-finance) with the head of machine learning at Goldman Sachs (an investment bank) on how ML is transforming finance.  

  * An Example of Applying Binary Classification ML Models to [Trading Currencies.](http://nrl.northumbria.ac.uk/34544/1/Evaluating%20machine%20learning.pdf)
    *  This paper, published in Expert Systems, looks at dozens of different ML models, including logistic regression trees, setting up a binary classification problem (i.e., up or down days, y = '0' or '1') in order to trade currencies. A few models perform poorly, but some generate average returns as high as 20% per year. 
 
  *   Quantitative asset management has only recently been applying machine learning, but is [realizing big benefits from doing so.](https://dachxiu.chicagobooth.edu/download/ML.pdf) 
      *  This paper from academics at The University of Chicago and AQR (a large quantitative hedge fund manager) compare the performance of traditional statistical models used to forecast stock returns to the performance when deploying machine learning techniques (including random forests, but also many of the techniques we’ll learn in subsequent units). While dense, consider reading if you’re interested in a detailed contrast between traditional methods for forecasting stock returns and those involving machine learning.
