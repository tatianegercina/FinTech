### 4. Instructor Do: Walking into the Algorithms Forest (5 min)

In this lesson, students will be introduced to tree based algorithms and the `sklearn` modules that implements this algorithms family.

**Files:**

* [Lesson 11.2 Slides]()

Open the lesson slides, go to the _Walking into the Algorithms Forest_ section and highlight the following:

* Tree based algorithms, are part of the supervised machine learning methods.

* These kind of algorithms, can be used to solve classification or regression problems.

* These algorithms are quite used in finance for assessing risk, preventing fraud or fighting money laundering.

* In contrast to linear models, tree based algorithms can map non-linear relationships in data.

Explain to students, that linear models are not always an straight line, even a parabolic curve is a linear model, it just have a different shape.

* Predicting the price of an stock is an example of a linear problem.

* Predicting if a credit applications is going to be fraudulent or not, is an example of a non-linear problem.

* The most used tree based algorithms are decision trees, random forest and gradient boosting trees.

* `sklearn` has two modules that implement tree based algorithms.

  * [`sklearn.tree`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.tree) implements decision trees.

  * [`sklearn.ensemble`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.ensemble) offers implementations for random forest, gradient boosting, boosting and bagging algorithms.
