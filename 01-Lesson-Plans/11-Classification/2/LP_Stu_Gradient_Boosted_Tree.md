### 16. Students Do: Gradient Boosted Tree (10 mins)

Students will complete a MSMD activity where they use the **sklearn** `GradientBoostedClassifier` **boosting** algorithm to implement ensemble learning.

**Instructions:**

* [README.md](Activities/16-Stu_Gradient_Boosted_Tree/README.md)

**Files:**

* [gradient_boosted_tree.ipynb](Activities/16-Stu_Gradient_Boosted_Tree/Unsolved/gradient_boosted_tree.ipynb)

### 17. Instructor Do: Review Practice (5 mins)

**Files:**

* [solution.js](Activities/02-Stu_Practice/Solved/solution.js)

Open the solution and explain the following:

* X is used for Y.

* X can also be used for Z.

Ask for any remaining questions before moving on.
