## 11.2 Lesson Plan: Trees and Regression

---

### Overview

By the end of Today's class, students will recognize the benefits of using trees based algorithms for classifications problems, also students will gain hands on experience on weak learners and ensemble methods such as bagging and boosting.

TodayÂ´s lesson also introduce students on dealing with categorical data in machine learning, students will be able to identify when is worth to use categorical data as a feature in a model.

### Class Objectives

By the end of the unit, students will be able to:

* Identify when categorical variables are useful for a machine learning algorithm.

* Perform feature engineering on categorical features and convert labels to numerical class representations.

* Recognize the type of business cases where decision trees and random forests are a suitable solution for classifications problems.

* Demonstrate how random forest performs better than decision trees by avoiding overfitting.

* Identify the pros and cons of tree based algorithms.

* Understand the implications of overfitting and how boosting and bagging can help to deal with it.

* Apply Gradient Tree Boosting models in classification problems.
