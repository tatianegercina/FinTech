### FAQs

<summary>What is Algorithmic Trading and why do I need to understand it?</summary><br>

Algorithmic trading is the trading of stocks using automated computer generated buy/sell decisions.  This type of trading is becoming more and more popular in the FinTech world largely because it can be backtested with historical and current data to prove profitability and for its ability to mitigate profit loss due to human error.  Some algorithmic trading strategies use the technology to inform their end decisions, while others run on auto-pilot - predicting and executing trades autonomously.

Algorithmic trading bots consist of three components:
- Signals:  Information that is useful for predicting the asset movement (such as performance and evaluation metrics, public sentiment).
- Entry Rules:  A decision rule telling you when to buy an asset (such as when a signal reaches a pre-specified, high enough level).
- Exit Rules:  A decision rule telling you when to sell or dispose of an asset (such as when a signal reaches a pre-specified, low enough level).

<summary>What is the difference between technical analysis and fundamental analysis?</summary><br>

The two major schools of thought in trading analysis are technical and fundamental analysis.  They are both are beneficial techniques used to develop trading strategies, however the methods of each are quite different.
<blockquote>
<details>
<summary>Technical Analysis</summary><br>

Technical analysis is used to determine the value of a stock based only on the patterns and trends in its price movements and volume.  Examples of technical analysis methods are Moving Averagess and Bollinger Bands.  Technical analysts use charts representing these indicators and look for known patterns in the trend lines such as pennants, flags and wedges.  Using these patterns, they attempt to predict the stock's future movements.  For an overview list of technical indicator patterns, check out [this](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/technical/112601.asp) Investopedia article.

<summary>Fundamental Analysis</summary><br>

Fundamental analysis attempts to determine the value of a stock based on qualitative factors like management style and business model, quantitative factors such as balance sheet numbers, and even emotional and subjective factors like public sentiment.  Fundamental analysts create complicated mathmatical forecasting models based on these factors, making many assumptions and applying different weights to various factors.
