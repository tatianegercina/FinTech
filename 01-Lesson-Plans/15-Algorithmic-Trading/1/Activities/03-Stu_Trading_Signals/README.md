# The Big Short

The real estate bubble that led to the financial crisis in 2008 resulted in one of the worst economic disasters since the Great Depression of 1929. During this period, housing prices fell precipitously, causing massive ripples throughout the U.S. economy and ultimately causing the stock market to crash. Some keen investors profited off of the recession by *shorting* the market or placing bets that the market would fall. Most, however, lost substantial value from their investment portfolios, including much-needed retirement accounts and savings accounts.

If you had an algorithm to monitor and *short* the market in 2008, could you have possibly *made* money? Create a dual moving average crossover strategy that would have shorted VNQ (Real Estate ETF) stock during the years between 2007 and 2009.
