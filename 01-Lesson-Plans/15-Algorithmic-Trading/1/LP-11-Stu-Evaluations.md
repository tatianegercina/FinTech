### 11. Students Do: Evaluations (15 mins)

Students complete a MSMD activity where they create a function to calculate portfolio evaluation metrics for their backtesting data. The activity is aimed to get students thinking about how the calculation of evaluation metrics can be incorporated into algorithmic training.

### 12. Instructor Do: Evaluations Activity Review (10 mins)

Open the solution, and explain the following:

* Evaluation metrics should be used to gauge algorithm performance. Commonly used evaluation metrics include cumulative returns, annualized returns, annual volatility, Sharpe ratio, and Sortino ratio.

* Remind students that even though algorithms can perform faster than humans, without emotional or mental fatigue, algorithms still need to be evaluated for performance. Explain that the best case scenario is to have the algorithm calculate and monitor evaluation metrics to help making decisions regarding when to buy and sell.

* X can also be used for Z.

Ask for any remaining questions before moving on.
