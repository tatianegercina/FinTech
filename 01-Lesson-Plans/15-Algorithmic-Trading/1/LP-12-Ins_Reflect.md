18. Instructor Do: Recap (10 min)
This activity will conclude the APIs Day 1. Recap the skills and concepts learned throughout the lesson. Engage the students by having students lead the recap as much as possible.

Ask if there's a student who would like to volunteer to summarize what was learned today.

Ask if there are any volunteers who would like to add to what the previous student stated.

Guide students and the recap session. Use the below sample statements and questions to guide students if student engagement and participation is low. Only use these if necessary; let the students drive the session as much as possible.

Some of the APIs used in the lesson were Quandl, World Bank, Numbers API, Deck of Cards, U.S. Spending Stats, Random Jokes, etc. What APIs did you find to be the most interesting?

What APIs were the most useful? In what ways could you continue to use these APIs, especially in everyday life?

Ask students to identify two things they'd like to practice on from today's lesson that they might have struggled with conceptually. Encourage them to do additional practice and reading outside of class to reinforce the knowledge and skill.

Finish the recap with a few statements of encouragement.

Tell students they need to give themselves, yet gain, a round of applause. They've added yet another valuable tool to their developer's toolkit.

Remind students that completing this amount of work in this time period already means they've proven their aptitude. It's just growth from here.

The next step for APIs is to work with authenticated APIs, as well as software development kits (SDKs) like PLAID, a personal finance API that can connect to multiple accounts. This is where the class will get heavy into accessing and using financial data via APIs.

Before students leave for the end of the day, give them a small homework assignment. Instruct students to sign up for the below APIs. Students will need to sign up for these APIs before coming to the next class; these APIs will be used in Unit 5.2. Slack out the links so that students will have them. Students who do not have access will not be able to complete all of Unit 5.2's activities.

Emphasize to students that they should be signing up for free, development accounts. There is no need to purchase any services.
