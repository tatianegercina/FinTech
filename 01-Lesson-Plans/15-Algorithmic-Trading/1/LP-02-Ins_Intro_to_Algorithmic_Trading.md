Navigate to the slideshow and present the following questions and answers about algorithmic trading:

* What is algorithmic trading?

  **Answer:** Algorithmic trading is an automated form of trading in which a computer program places trades (buy or sell) based on particular instructions defined by a mathematical model (algorithm). For example, a simple algorithm could be to sell 100 shares of a stock when the intraday percentage return of a stock exceeds -3%.

* Why is algorithmic trading so prevalent today?

  **Answer:** Advances in network technology and computing power have provided greater access and depth to algorithmic trading; platforms like Quantopian have opened the door to novice algorithmic traders, and more capable machines have been used to implement iterative-based learning on increasingly large data sets--otherwise known as *machine learning* or *deep learning*.

* Why use algorithmic trading?

  **Answer:** While there are many benefits to using algorithmic trading over traditional/manual trading, the two main benefits are: one, algorithmic trading can be backtested using historical and real-time data to see if it is a profitable trading strategy and, two, it reduces the possibility of human error in which traders mistime trades based on emotional and psychological factors.

* Who performs algorithmic trading?
