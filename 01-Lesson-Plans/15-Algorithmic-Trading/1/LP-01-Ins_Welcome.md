## 15.1 Lesson Plan: Algorithmic Trading

---

### Overview

Today's class will focus on using last unit's topics of deep neural networks to implement machine learning based trading or algorithmic trading. In particular, students will use deep neural nets to predict stock returns of multiple assets within a portfolio and trigger signal-based strategies for trading multiple assets at the same time.

### Class Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Delineate what algorithmic trading is and who does it.

* Implement deep neural networks to predict stock returns of multiple assets.

* Construct signal-based trading strategies from predicted stock returns such as momentum and mean reversion.

* Rank multiple signal-based trading strategies by potential alpha generation.

* Back-test signal-based trading strategies to calculate the earning potential of the algorithm using historical data.

* Automate the purchase and sale of multiple assets using the recommended or best-ranked trading strategy.

* Build portfolios with specific allocations to each underlying asset based on the predicted alpha generation of each stock.

### Instructor Notes

* Today's lesson will consist of elements taught in the Pandas and Machine Learning 

* Not everyone will have a background in trading. Therefore, be thorough when explaining specific trading strategies and key terms.

* Have your TAs keep track of time with the [Time Tracker](TimeTracker.xlsx).
