### 2. Student Do: Trading Functions (10 mins)

In this activity, students will be given a random sequence of trading function names and will be asked to propose the correct order of the functions if they were to be implemented in an algorithmic trading application.

**Files:**

* [Instructions](Activities/01-Stu_Trading_Functions/README.md)

* [Solution](Activities/01-Stu_Trading_Functions/Solved/README.md)

Open the slides and explain the following to students:

* Before designing an algorithmic trading framework, students need to first determine the order or workflow of the individual functions that constitute the holistic operation of the framework. Therefore, in this case, students will need to decide what is the proper order for a random sequence of trading functions if they were to be implemented in an algorithmic trading application.

* Doing this exercise helps students to mentally map out the process required for an end-to-end algorithmic trading application and should reinforce the importance of the core algorithmic trading concepts taught in day 1.

Then, slack out the instructions and review the solution when ready:
