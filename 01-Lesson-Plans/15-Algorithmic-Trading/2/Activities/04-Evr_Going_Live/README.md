# Everyone Do: Going Live with CCXT

Code along with the instructor to complete the following tasks:

Now that you have access to the Kraken cryptocurrency exchange, we can modify the algorithmic trading framework to read in historical pricing data from Kraken rather than a local CSV file.

## Instructions

Using the [starter file](Unsolved/jarvis.py), complete the following steps:

1. Import the ccxt and os libraries.

2. Identify the `fetch_data` function as the framework component that will need to be modified.

3. Replace the underlying read CSV functionality for the `fetch_data` function with the ability to read historical pricing data from Kraken.

    1. Import your Kraken environment variables and set up the credentials for the Kraken class of the ccxt library.

    2. Fetch daily candlestick bar data from `BTC/USD` using the `fetch_ohlcv` function of the ccxt library.

    3. Import the data as a Pandas DataFrame and set the columns to 'timestamp', 'open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume'.

    4. Create a new 'date' column by converting the epoch timestamp to a date using the `to_datetime` function and `unit` parameter.

    5. Set the BTC/USD historical prices DataFrame as the return object of the `fetch_data` function.

## Hint

Make sure that while you are modifying the underlying code for the `fetch_data` function, you are not disrupting the high-level input/output workflow of the trading framework.
