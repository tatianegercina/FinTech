# Trading Functions

It's time to start thinking about your new algorithmic trading application!

To begin visualizing the process for the trading framework, think about what the correct order of the below functions should be and why.

## Instructions

Open the [unsolved file](Unsolved/ninjatrader_v1.py) and produce the correct order (top to bottom) of the following trading functions:

* evaluate_metrics()

* generate_signal()

* fetch_data()

* build_dashboard()

* main()

* update_dashboard()

* execute_backtest()

* initialize()

* execute_trade_strategy()


## Hint

Imagine data were to flow from start to finish, which functions seem the most appropriate?
