### 3. Everyone Do: Algorithmic Trading Framework (15 mins)

In this activity, instructors will guide students on how to begin encapsulating their trading calculations into trading functions that can be used in an algorithmic trading framework. The purpose of this activity is to port the functionality that was achieved in the previous class into an end-to-end implementation of an algorithmic trading application.

**Files:** [ninja_trader.ipynb](Activities/02-Evr_Algo_Trading_Framework/Solved/ninja_trader.py)

Quickly discuss the following before proceeding onward to the walk through:

* Now that students have completed their workflow design for their new algorithmic trading applications, it is now time to take what they learned in the previous day and assemble the code together in a single framework/application.

* Students should keep in mind the concept of inputs and outputs (I/O). This is because as data within the algorithmic trading application flows from start to finish, the underlying functions called therein will require inputs and return outputs according to their specific purposes.

Open the solution file and walk through the following with the class:

* 

Ask if there are any questions before moving on.
