### 8. Everyone Do: Async Trading (15 mins)

In this activity, now that students understand how to transition their trading frameworks from performing batch processing data loads to real-time data loads with the help of asyncio, instructors will now guide students on how to execute trades based on the continual flow of data.

The purpose of this activity is to build upon the instructions from the previous activity to not only implement real-time data loads with the help of asyncio, but also to implement the trading logic required to make a decision to either buy, sell, or hold.
