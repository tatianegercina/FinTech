### 1. Instructor Do: Welcome Class (5 min)

In this section, students will review the algorithmic trading concepts taught in the previous class to prepare them for today's consolidation of multiple trading functions (signal generation, backtesting, trade evaluation, etc.) into a single trading framework. This section is a key opportunity to take a step back and understand the *process* of algorithmic trading, so as to later transition to the architecture or infrastructure of an algorithmic trading framework.

Welcome students to the second day of algorithmic trading and quickly review the following:

* What is algorithmic trading?

  **Answer:** Algorithmic trading is the concept of utilizing a machine to automate the process of buying and selling assets based on specific trading signal criteria and decision-making logic.

* What is a trading signal?

  **Answer:** A trading signal is the point at which a technical indicator, such as the crossover of two moving averages (short MA and long MA), suggests an opportunity for action--namely whether an individual trader or algorithmic trading program should issue a buy or sell order for a security (such as a stock) at that point in time.

* What is backtesting?

  **Answer:** Backtesting is the process for measuring the overall performance of a trading strategy using historical stock prices to simulate executed trades dictated by the calculated trading signals and trade decision logic.

* What are algorithmic trading evaluation metrics?

  **Answer:** Metrics that showcase information such as overall portfolio or per-trade performance. Examples include cash balance, total portfolio value, per-trade profits and losses, and dates of entry and exit trades.

* What is a trading dashboard?

  **Answer:** Like other dashboards, a *trading dashboard* consolidates and presents multiple facets of information pertaining to the performance of an algorithmic trading application, allowing a user to interact with the data via tables and plots (visualizations).

Mention to students that going forward in today's class, they should not only keep in mind the distinct purposes or functions of each trading calculation, but the chronology and dependencies of each function as well.

Answer any questions before moving on.
