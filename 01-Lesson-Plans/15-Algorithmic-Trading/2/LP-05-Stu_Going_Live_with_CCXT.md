### 5. Student Do: Going Live with CCXT (15 mins)

In this activity, students will now get the chance to connect their algorithmic trading applications to the Kraken cryptocurrency exchange. In particular, rather than read data locally from a CSV file, students will modify their `fetch_data` functions to connect to Kraken via the CCXT library and read historical pricing data for BTC/USD.

The purpose of this activity is to showcase the "plug-and-play" feature of a framework. In other words, as long as the work flow of the overall framework remains consistent, individual components of the framework, such as the `fetch_data` function, can be modified to fit distinct needs.
