### 4. Instructor Do: Recap (15 min)

In this activity, instructors will briefly re-cap the process of training and using a Random Forest trading model, discuss the ways in which the model can potentially be improved, and consider deploying the model through alternative means such as AWS' Sagemaker--a machine learning cloud service that enables users to build, train, and deploy machine learning models quickly and conveniently.

Open the slideshow and quickly re-cap the following:

* What did we learn today?

  **Answer:** We learned how to implement a machine learning model (Random Forest) to make predictions of next-day daily returns, given a set of trading signals derived from raw asset closing prices.

* What was the process for implementing a machine learning trading model?

  **Answer** The process for implementing a machine learning model, regardless of domain, generally includes the following: preparing the data, splitting the data into train and test datasets, fitting the x and y train data to the model, making predictions from the x test data, and comparing the predicted results to the y test data (actual results) to evaluate the performance of the overall model.

* What was the main takeaway from today's lesson?

  **Answer:** That the process for implementing a machine learning trading model can be fairly straightforward, but the ability to construct a sophisticated enough trading model that can outperform the markets will require more effort via further understanding of the markets and fine-tuning of the model (more features and therefore information).

Then, ask students if they have any further questions before moving onto the following talking points:
