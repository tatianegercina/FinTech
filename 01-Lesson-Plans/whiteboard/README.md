## Unit 2 - Whiteboard Interviews

### Overview

Our Whiteboarding Workshops are intended to give students three things:

1. A repertoire of problem-solving strategies;

2. Guidelines for _discussing_ their problem solving process; and

3. Practice applying those guidelines.

Instructors will kick off each workshop with an overview of problem-solving strategies and an overview of how to use the discussion guidelines, and then allow students to run their own peer-interviews for the rest of class.

Since the only difference between workshops is the selection of interview questions, Instructors are provided a single Time Tracker and abbreviated Lesson Plan.
