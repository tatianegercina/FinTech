### 2. Instructor Do: Introduction to Unsupervised Learning (10 mins)

After an introduction to machine learning and NLP, students are eager to learn more about this matter. In this activity, students will be introduced to unsupervised learning and its most relevant applications.

**Files:**

* [Lesson 13.1 Slides]()

Open the lesson slides, move to the _Introduction to Unsupervised Learning_ section and highlight the following:

* In general terms, machine learning has two main areas of application, supervised and unsupervised learning.

Students are already familiar to supervised machine learning algorithms and applications, so highlight to students the main differences between these types of learning.

| Supervised Learning                      | Unsupervised Learning                    |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Input data is labeled                    | Input data is unlabeled                  |
| Uses training datasets                   | Uses just input datasets                 |
| **Goal:** Predict a class or value label | **Goal:** Determine patterns or grouping |

* A fruit basket could be used as a quotidian example to understand these types of learning. The _supervised learning_ approach will try to answer the question `Is that fruit an apple?`, whereas using an _unsupervised learning_ approach, we will try to answer the question `How the different fruits can be classified on the basket?`.

* The main applications of unsupervised machine learning on industry are:

  * **Clustering:** It allows to automatically split the dataset into groups according to similarity. It can be used for customer segmentation and targeting.

  * **Anomaly Detection:** Automatically discovers unusual data points in a dataset. It's useful in identifying fraudulent transactions, discovering faulty pieces of hardware, or identifying an outlier caused by a human error during data entry.

As an icebreaking activity, conduct a facilitated discussion about how companies are using customer segmentation to create personalized customer experiences. Start by sharing the following stats and ask students what they think about them:

* 75% of Netflix viewer activity is driven by recommendation ([Source](http://blog.springtab.com/personalization-examples-netflix/)).
* 35% of Amazon’s sales are generated through their recommendation engine ([Source](https://www.martechadvisor.com/articles/customer-experience-2/recommendation-engines-how-amazon-and-netflix-are-winning-the-personalization-battle/)).
* Netflix’s recommendation system saves the company an estimated $1Billion per year through reduced churn ([Source](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2843948)).

You can ask the following questions to class:

* How a bank could use customer segmentation to improve their products?

  **Sample Answer:** Instead of having a generic offer of credit cards, a bank could use customer segmentation to offer credit cards according to demographics such as: age, geography, gender, generation (e.g. Millennials and Baby Boomers), income level, marital status, etc.

* How an investment portfolio can be improved using customer segmentation?

  **Sample Answer:** Using customer segmentation a portfolio can be categorized by industry, location, revenue, account size, and number of employees to reveal where risk and opportunity live within the portfolio. These patterns can provide key measurable data for more predictive credit risk management.

Close the dialogue commenting to students that, unsupervised learning and algorithms like K-Means, are the tools behind this kind of magic that is perceived by customers.

Answer any pending question an continue to the next activity.
