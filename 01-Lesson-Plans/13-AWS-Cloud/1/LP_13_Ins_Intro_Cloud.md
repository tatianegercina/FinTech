### 13. Instructor Do: Welcome to the Cloud and Amazon Web Services (10 min)

In this activity, students will be introduced to the cloud and the generalities of Amazon Web Services.

**Files:**

* [Lesson 13.1 slides]()

Open the lesson slides, move to the _Welcome to The Cloud and Amazon Web Services_ section and introduce the concept of _The Cloud_ by asking students to share what they think the cloud is.

Collect two or three answers, and emphasize the following points:

* In essence, the cloud refers to the on-demand availability of computer system resources.

* The computing resources include: compute processing power, data storage, and other services.

* There is no need to have physical access to the hardware, it is managed through the internet (through public and/or private networks).

* Normally, you pay as you go for what you use (sometimes down to the second or byte) with little or no upfront costs.

* Services are usually charged like a utility service (think electricity bill).

* Cloud computing is usually cheaper due to the economics of scale (and no upfront cost of physical hardware, setup or provisioning).

* You get access to unlimited resources (in theory, maybe not practice).

* There are multiple services models, with trade-offs in responsibility and control. The most common are:
  * **Infrastructure as a service (IaaS):** Online services that provide APIs to access different infrastructure such as servers, virtual machines, storage, load balancers or network interfaces (e.g. [Azure Virtual Machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-machines/)).
  * **Platform as a service (PaaS):** Provides a platform that allow customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining their own physical infrastructure (e.g. [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/)).
  * **Software as a service (SaaS):** Refers to a software licensing and delivery model where software is licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted (e.g. [Microsoft Office 365](https://www.office.com)).
  * **Function/Code as a service (FaaS):** Also known as _serverless computing_, it offers a remote procedure call that enables the deployment of individual functions in the cloud that run in response to events (e.g. [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)).

* _Clouds_ can be created in a private data center (_Private Cloud_), in a data center managed by a provider (_Public Cloud_) or in a combination of both (_Hybrid Cloud_)

* Cloud computing is considered secure enough to be used by many banks and government offices.

* Cloud services allow you to scale your resources up and down as required.

* There are multiple Cloud service providers, including: Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Oracle and IBM.

* Some of the disadvantages of the cloud are:

  * Having to trust a 3rd party provider with your data (encryption can sometimes address this).
  * You probably have to give up some privacy and confidentiality.
  * You depend on the Service Level Agreements of a provider for issues to be addressed.
  * Incidents such as hardware failure are inevitable but you have less oversight on their resolution.
  * Hardware might be shared with other tenants, "bad neighbors" can affect your resources.
  * Clouds can fail and have downtime, including due to planned maintenances out of your control.

Visit the [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/) homepage and cover the following points:

* Launched in March 2006, Amazon Web Services ("AWS", a subsidiary of Amazon.com) popularized the concept of "Cloud Computing".

* AWS comprises more than 140 services, including technologies for compute, storage, networking, database, analytics, IoT, Machine Learning and more.

* AWS started with a service called _Elastic Compute Cloud_ (or "_EC2_").

* Although Amazon didn't invent the concept, it pioneered the Cloud's adoption.

* AWS is the leading cloud computing provider (in 2019).

* [Thousands of companies use AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/all/), including: 2U, AirBnb, Adobe, CapitalOne, Comcast, Dropbox, Expedia, GE, Kellogg's, McDonalds's, Philips, Yelp, and many more.
