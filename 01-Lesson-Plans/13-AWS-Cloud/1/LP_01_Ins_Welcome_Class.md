## 13.1 Lesson Plan: Unsupervised Learning and The Cloud

### Overview

Today's class will introduce students to unsupervised learning and cloud services. Students will gain hands-on experience with the K-Means algorithm, one of the most used unsupervised algorithms for clustering. Additionally, students will learn how to speed up ML algorithms by using principal component analysis (PCA), as well as to recognize and explain at least three main differences between supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms.

The concept of _The Cloud_ is presented to students, by highlighting the importance that these kind of computing services have for FinTech professionals, given that the cloud allows to scale machine learning models to be used by hundreds or thousands of users.

As a prelude for the rest of the unit, an introduction to Amazon Web Services (AWS) and AWS SageMaker is given the end of the day.

### Class Objectives

By the end of the class, students will be able to:

* Recognize the differences between supervised and unsupervised machine learning.

* Apply the K-Means algorithm to identify clusters on a given dataset.

* Diagnose what are the data preprocessing tasks that a dataset would need to apply the K-Means algorithm.

* Demonstrate how the K-Means algorithm is useful for customer segmentation.

* Speed-up the ML algorithms using principal component analysis.

* Understand the basic concepts of the cloud and Amazon Web Services.

* Recognize the main features of AWS SageMaker.

### Instructor Notes

* Students have learned the generalities of ML and they already know how to apply supervised ML; this class offers an overview of unsupervised ML, students will have hands-on experience using K-Means on a business case scenario, to demonstrate how unsupervised ML could add value to business decision making.

* Understating unsupervised learning may be challenging, however everyone is a customer and are familiar with how companies use data to target customers or potential customers to offer products and services, try to use analogies about how companies like [Amazon, Netflix, Google](https://www.pointillist.com/blog/customer-behavior-data/), or [Target](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/) are using customer segmentation to provide a customized offer, or [how Spotify is using segmentation](https://towardsdatascience.com/in-this-article-i-provide-a-detailed-analysis-of-spotify-as-a-company-music-industry-direction-eeb945d7257c) to improve their products and services.

* There are several theoretical aspects behind the K-Means algorithm, focus the class on the practical application of this algorithm for customer segmentation and share the additional references presented on the slides for those students interested on having a deeper understanding.

* Be sure to set the pace for the class. Encourage students to attend office hours if they feel lost or stuck. Also encourage students to work with partners.

* Have your TAs keep track with the [Time Tracker](TimeTracker.xlsx)

### 1. Instructor Do: Welcome Class (5 mins)

Welcome the class to Unit 13, explain students that on this unit they will learn about unsupervised machine learning, also they will recognize the importance of the cloud and cloud services to deploy enterprise machine learning applications.

Make sure that all students have created their AWS account, ask TAs to assist any student that could be pending on creating it.
