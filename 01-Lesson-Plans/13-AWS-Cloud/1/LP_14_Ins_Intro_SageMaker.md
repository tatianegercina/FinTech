### 14. Instructor Do: Intro to Amazon SageMaker (5 min)

In this activity, students will learn how Amazon SageMaker works and what are its main features.

Open your web browser, visit the [AWS SageMaker homepage](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) and highlight the following points:

* Amazon SageMaker is a _platform service_ which consists of three main components that work together or independently:

  * **Build:** Notebook service to explore and prepare the data
  * **Train:** Model training environment and infrastructure
  * **Deploy:** Publish and host a model on an HTTP API endpoint or execute a batch prediction / inference.

* Additionally, Amazon SageMaker includes layers that work across all the components:

  * **Ground Truth:** Data labeling service.
  * **Tuning:** Automatic Model Tuning by searching hyper-parameter values for best model fit.
  * **Algorithms:** Built-in algorithms (K-NN, K-Means, PCA, Forecasting, and many more).
  * **Frameworks:** Deep learning framework containers (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, MXNet, PyTorch, and others).
  * **Docker containers:** Bring your own model or algorithm container and publish to [AWS ECR](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/).
  * **Marketplace:** Amazon SageMaker integrates with AWS Marketplace to find, buy and deploy third-party algorithms and models.

Review some of the advantages of using Amazon SageMaker:

* Provides tools that streamline a typical workflow for creating a machine learning model.
* Its infrastructure enables growth at scale with on-demand compute instances and dynamic storage.
* Pricing for building, training and hosting is billed by the second, no minimum fees and no upfront commitments.
* Advertises "One-click Training" and "One-click Deployment".
* Comes with built-in security, which includes access controls and monitoring.

Answer any questions before moving on.
