### 14. Instructor Do: Welcome to the Cloud and AWS (10 mins)

Introduce the concept of _Cloud Computing_ by asking students to share what they think Cloud Computing is.
Collect the answer and emphasize the following points:

* In essence, Cloud Computing refers to the on-demand availability of computer system resources.
* The computing resources include: compute processing power, data storage, and other services.
* There is no need to have physical access to the hardware, it is managed through the internet (through public and/or private networks)
* You pay as you go for what you use (sometimes down to the second or byte) with little or no upfront costs
* Services are usually charged like a utility service (think electricity bill)
* Cloud computing is usually cheaper due to the economics of scale (and no upfront cost of physical hardware, setup or provisioning)
* You get access to unlimited resources (in theory, maybe not practice)
* There are multiple services models; with trade-offs in responsibility and control. The most common being:
  * _Infrastructure as a service_ (IaaS)
  * _Platform as a service_ (PaaS)
  * _Software as a service_ (SaaS)
  * _Function/Code as a service_ (FaaS)
* "Clouds" can be in a private datacenter (_Private Cloud_) or in one managed by a provider (_Public Cloud_) or in a combination of both (_Hybrid Cloud_)
* Cloud computing is considered secure enough to be used by many banks and government offices
* Cloud services allow you to scale your resources up and down as required
* There are multiple Cloud service providers, including: Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Oracle and IBM.

Some of the disadvantages of the cloud are:

* Having to trust a 3rd party provider with your data (encryption can sometimes address this)
* You probably have to give up some privacy and confidentiality
* You depend on the Service Level Agreements of a provider for issues to be addressed
* Incidents such as hardware failure are inevitable but you have less oversight on their resolution
* Hardware might be shared with other tenants, "bad neighbors" can affect your resources
* Clouds can fail and have downtime, including due to planned maintenances out of your control

Visit the Amazon Web Services (AWS) homepage and cover the following points:
<https://aws.amazon.com/>

Launched in March 2006, Amazon Web Services ("AWS", a subsidiary of Amazon.com) popularized the concept of "Cloud Computing".
It started with a service called _Elastic Compute Cloud_ (or "_EC2_"). 

* Although Amazon didn't invent the concept, it pioneered the Cloud's adoption.
* AWS is the leading cloud computing provider (in 2019)
* Thousands of companies use AWS, including: 2U, AirBnb, Adobe, CapitalOne, Comcast, Dropbox, Expedia, GE, Kellogg's, McDonalds's, Philips, Yelp, etc.

* AWS offer over 100 different cloud computing services, including technologies for compute, storage, networking, database, analytics, IoT, Machine Learning and more.
