## 13.1 Lesson Planâ€”Unsupervised Learning and The Cloud

### Overview

Today's class will introduce students to unsupervised learning and cloud services. Students will gain hands-on experience with the k-means algorithm, one of the most used unsupervised learning algorithms for clustering. Students also will learn how to speed up machine learning (ML) algorithms by using principal component analysis (PCA), as well as to recognize and explain at least three main differences between supervised and unsupervised ML algorithms.

The concept of **the cloud** is presented to students by highlighting the importance that these kinds of computing services have for FinTech professionals, given that the cloud allows scaling ML models to be used by hundreds or thousands of users.

Students will be introduced to Amazon Web Services (AWS), the cloud platform that is going to be used in this unit, as well as to the AWS resources that students will learn to deploy ML models in the cloud and create conversational interfaces, such as, robo advisors.

As a prelude for the rest of the unit, a demo of the homework is presented.

### Class Objectives

By the end of the class, students will be able to:

* Recognize the differences between supervised and unsupervised machine learning.

* Apply the k-means algorithm to identify clusters on a given dataset.

* Diagnose what the data preprocessing tasks are that a dataset would need to apply the k-means algorithm.

* Demonstrate how the k-means algorithm is useful for customer segmentation.

* Speed up the machine-learning algorithms using principal component analysis.

* Understand the basic concepts of the cloud and Amazon Web Services.

* Describe the benefits of the cloud for FinTech professionals.

* Recognize the main features of Amazon SageMaker.

* Demonstrate how to run Jupyter notebooks in Amazon SageMaker Studio.

### Instructor Notes

* Students have learned the generalities of machine learning, and they already know how to apply supervised machine learning; this class offers an overview of unsupervised machine learning, students will have hands-on experience using k-means on a business case scenario to demonstrate how unsupervised machine learning could add value to business decision-making.

* Understanding unsupervised learning may be challenging, however everyone is a customer and is familiar with how companies use data to target customers or potential customers to offer products and services. Try to use analogies about how companies like [Amazon, Netflix, Google](https://www.pointillist.com/blog/customer-behavior-data/), or [Target](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/) are using customer segmentation to provide customized offers, or [how Spotify is using segmentation](https://towardsdatascience.com/in-this-article-i-provide-a-detailed-analysis-of-spotify-as-a-company-music-industry-direction-eeb945d7257c) to improve its products and services.

* There are several theoretical aspects behind the k-means and PCA algorithms, focus the class on the practical application of these algorithms for customer segmentation and share the additional references presented on the slides for those students interested in having a deeper understanding.

* The cloud is a core concept for FinTech professionals; however, it might be seen as complex and nebulous for some students; it's important to highlight how companies like Amazon Web Services have reduced the technological complexity behind the cloud, by offering user-friendly interfaces that allow deployment of a machine-learning model with few lines of code and some mouse clicks.

* On Day 1, the homework demo is presented; be sure to get familiar with the homework's solutions before the class.

* Be sure to set the pace for the class. Encourage students to attend office hours if they feel lost or stuck. Also, encourage students to work with partners.

* **Important!** Slack out the disclaimer for [AWS Free Tier](../Supplemental/AWS-Free-Tier.md) services at the end of today's class. Explain to students that while we are only using free tier services in class, they should review this documentation to avoid accidentally incurring charges.

* Prior to class, make sure that all students have created their AWS account, and ask TAs to help troubleshoot any issues. If any students are unable to access a free tier account, ask that they pair up with a peer for this week.

### 1. Instructor Do: Welcome Class (10 min)

In this activity, students will learn what is the cloud, what are its pros and cons and why the cloud is important for FinTech professionals. The students will also be introduced to AWS and the particular services that will be used in this Unit. This activity concludes presenting a short demo of the conversational interfaces that will be done in class.

Welcome the class to Unit 13, explain to students that this is going to be a fun unit since they are going to learn how to deploy ML models in the cloud using AWS, and also, they will create conversational interfaces to implement bots that will be able to understand and response using natural language.

Open the lesson slides, move to the "Welcome to the Cloud and Amazon Web Services" section and start talking about the cloud by asking to the students the following question.

* What do you think the cloud is?

Collect two or three answers and emphasize the following points:

* In essence, the cloud refers to the on-demand availability of computer systems resources.

* The computing resources may include: data storage, computing power, and collaboration platforms.

* There is no need to have physical access to the hardware; it is managed through the Internet using public or private networks.

* Normally, you pay as you go for what services you use (sometimes down to the second or byte) with little or no upfront costs.

* Cloud computing is usually cheaper due to the economics of scale (and no upfront cost of physical hardware, setup, or provisioning).

Explain to students that the cloud is a core tool for FinTech professionals; they will learn how to leverage their Python and ML skills using AWS to deploy models and business applications that could be reached by hundreds or thousands of people.

Continue with the slides and highlight the following points about the models of cloud services:

* There are multiple cloud services models, with trade-offs in responsibility and control. The most common are:

  * **Infrastructure as a service (IaaS):** Online services that provide APIs to access different infrastructures such as servers, virtual machines, storage, load balancers, or network interfaces (e.g., [Azure Virtual Machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-machines/)).

  * **Platform as a service (PaaS):** Provides a platform that allow customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining their own physical infrastructure (e.g., [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/)).

  * **Software as a service (SaaS):** Refers to a software licensing and delivery model where software is licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted (e.g., [Microsoft Office 365](https://www.office.com)).

  * **Function/code as a service (FaaS):** Also known as serverless computing, it offers a remote procedure call that enables the deployment of individual functions in the cloud that run in response to events (e.g., [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)).

* Clouds can be created in a private data center (private cloud), in a data center managed by a provider (public cloud) or in a combination of both (hybrid cloud)

* Cloud computing is considered secure enough to be used by many banks and government offices worldwide.

* Cloud services allow you to scale your resources up and down as required.

* There are multiple cloud service providers, including Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Oracle, and IBM.

Explain to students that, despite we can trust in the the cloud and it is practically everywhere in our daily life, there are some of the disadvantages that we may take into account.

Continue on the slides and highlight the following disadvantages of the cloud:

* You have to trust a third-party provider with your data (encryption can address this).

* You probably have to give up some privacy and confidentiality.

* You depend on the service level agreements of a provider for issues to be addressed.

* Incidents such as hardware failure are inevitable, but you have less oversight on their resolution.

* Hardware might be shared with other tenants; "bad neighbors" can affect your resources.

* Clouds can fail and have downtime, including those due to planned maintenances out of your control.

Open your browser, navigate to the [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) homepage and cover the following points:

* Launched in March 2006, AWS popularized the concept of cloud computing and pioneered the cloud's adoption.

* AWS comprises more than 140 services, including technologies for computing, storage, networking, database, analytics, IoT, machine learning, and more.

* AWS launches its first region in Canada in 2016, it's called `ca-central-1`.

* Having an AWS Canadian region, allow customers in Canada to offer cloud services that are complaint with the Canadian cloud services regulations.

* Thousands of companies use AWS worldwide, [in Canada we have some relevant success stories with companies like](https://aws.amazon.com/canada/customer-success-stories/) The National Bank of Canada, Porter Airlines, Toronto Star, The Globe and Mail, The Government of Ontario, and many more.

Slack out the following link to students if they want to learn more about AWS: [AWS Cloud Products](https://aws.amazon.com/products/)

Explain to students that in this unit, they will have hands-on experience with the following AWS services:

* **Amazon SageMaker:** To deploy ML models.
* **Amazon Lex:** To create conversational interfaces.
* **Amazon S3:** To store files in the cloud.
* **AWS Lambda:** To create serverless applications.

Conclude this introduction by telling students, that in this unit, they create two chatbots using Amazon Lex and AWS Lambda.

1. A cryptocurrency converter.

    ![Crypto converveter](Images/crypto-converter-demo.gif)

2. An investment portfolio robo advisor.

   ![RoboAdvisor Demo](Images/robo-advisor-demo.gif)

Answer any questions before moving on.

### 2. Everyone Do: Running Jupyter Notebooks in the Cloud with Amazon SageMaker (30 min)

In this activity, students will learn what Amazon SageMaker is and how they can start running Jupyter notebooks in the Cloud using Amazon SageMaker Studio. This activity starts with an short presentation of Amazon SageMaker using the lesson slides and concludes with a collaborative demo where you will guide the students throughout the process of getting started with this cloud service.

Open the lesson slides, move to the "Running Jupyter Notebooks in the Cloud with Amazon SageMaker" section and highlight the following:

* Amazon SageMaker is a platform service that allows software developers and data scientists to build, train, and deploy ML models in the cloud.

* Amazon SageMaker is composed by different tools aimed to ease the entire machine learning workflow, from managing datasets to building, training, and deploying a model.

* In this class, we will focus on gaining hands-on experience with Amazon SageMaker Studio, a web-based integrated development environment (IDE) that allow you to access all the services and tools needed to build, train, debug, deploy, and monitor your machine learning models.

* Amazon SageMaker provides some built-in ML algorithms, but also, it supports leading ML frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Apache MXNet, Keras, and Scikit-learn.

* Some of the advantages of using Amazon SageMaker are the following:

  * Provides tools that streamline a typical workflow for creating a ML model.

  * Its infrastructure enables growth at scale with on-demand compute instances and dynamic storage.

  * Building, training, and hosting is billed by the second with no minimum fees and no upfront commitments.

  * Productivity may be boosted with One-Click Training and One-Click Deployment.

  * Provides built-in security, which includes access controls and monitoring.

Explain to students that learning how to train and deploy models with Amazon SageMaker is a very in-demand skill that is worth learning more about.

Continue with the slides, show to students some of the companies that at currently using Amazon SageMaker and highlight the following:

* [**The Globe and Mail**](https://www.cantechletter.com/newswire/the-globe-and-mail-selects-aws-as-its-preferred-cloud-provider/) is using Amazon SageMaker to build models to retain existing customers and acquire new ones.

* [**Novartis**](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/industries/aws-and-novartis-re-inventing-pharma-manufacturing/?cs=4) is currently using Amazon SageMaker to build a computer vision-based model that will determine production line clearance.

* Using Amazon SageMaker engineers at [**Coinbase**](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/customers/innovators/coinbase/?cs=3) developed a machine learning-driven system that recognizes mismatches and anomalies in sources of user identification, allowing them to quickly take action against potential sources of fraud.

Now you will continue to demo how to get started with Amazon SageMaker Studio. Ask students to log-in into into the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) using their root user and to follow your steps throughout the process.

From the AWS Management Console, type `sagemaker` in the "Find Services" search box and choose `Amazon SageMaker` from the list.

![Launching Amazon SageMaker](Images/launching-sagemaker.png)

Explain to students that Amazon SageMaker Studio is currently offered by AWS as a general available preview version from the US East (Ohio) AWS region. Since it's a preview version, some aspects of the user interface (UI) may vary over the time it's released as a final version.

Despite they are going to use a preview version, explain to students that it's is fully functional and can be used free of charge during its preview period.

In the Amazon SageMaker homepage, click on the "Amazon SageMaker Studio" at the left menu to continue.

![Opening Amazon SageMaker Studio](Images/open-sagemaker-studio.png)

If you are not in the `US East (Ohio)` AWS region, you will see a warning message asking for switching to that region. Open the AWS regions list, select the `US East (Ohio)` AWS region, and click again in the "Amazon SageMaker Studio" option in the left menu.

![Switching to the US East (Ohio) AWS Region](Images/switching-to-ohio.gif)

Once you landed the Amazon SageMaker Studio homepage, explain to students that one of the main advantages of using this tool is that it deals with all the technical complexity of creating Amazon SageMaker instances which is a process that implies to deploy some [Amazon EC2 instances (similar to virtual machines)](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) and several privacy settings; following a manual process may take a few hours.

Continue by setting the initial configuration for Amazon SageMaker Studio, under the "Get Started" section, choose the "Quick Start" option and leave the default user name.

![Choosing the default user name for Amazon SageMaker Studio](Images/sagemaker-studio-user.png)

Next, in the "Execution role" option, click on the listbox and choose "Create a new rol"; a pop-up window named "Create an IAM role" will appear, select "Any S3 bucket" under the "S3 buckets you specify" option and click on the "Create role" button to continue.

![Create an execution role](Images/sagemaker-studio-execution-role.gif)

Continue the demo by clicking on the "Submit" button.

![Create an Amazon SageMaker Studio instance](Images/sagemaker-create-instance.png)

Next, the new instance of Amazon SageMaker Studio and the new user will be configured; you will be led to a new page were you may have to wait about five minutes.

![Amazon SageMaker Studio instance creation](Images/sagemaker-studio-instance-in-progress.png)

Once the Amazon SageMaker Studio instance is ready, you will see the following notification message; you may have to wait an additional minute or two until the Studio user is ready, after that, you will see the "Open Studio" link enabled.

![Amazon SageMaker Studio is ready](Images/sagemaker-studio-instance-ready.png)

Continue the demo by clicking on the "Open Studio" link, a new window (or tab) will be opened and you will see the following loading page until the UI of Amazon SageMaker Studio appears. **Note:** This process may take up to five minutes the first time.

![Loading Amazon SageMaker Studio](Images/sagemaker-studio-loading.png)

After the loading process ends, you will see the UI of Amazon SageMaker Studio. You may note that is practically the same UI as Jupyter lab but with a different color scheme.

![The Amazon SageMaker Studio UI](Images/sagemaker-studio-ui.png)

Explain to students that Amazon SageMaker Studio can be used in the same way they were working locally with Jupyter lab, the main difference is that Studio is a cloud application that allows to access all the computing power of AWS.

Continue the demo by clicking in the "Launcher" tab. Explain to students that Amazon SageMaker has different built-in images to create notebooks, these images are similar to a Python virtual environment. Continue the demo by ensuring the "Data Science" image is selected; next, click on the "Python 3" notebook option. A fresh Jupyter notebook will appear, test it by printing a `Hello!!` message.

![Creating a notebook in Amazon SageMaker Studio](Images/sagemaker-studio-create-notebook.gif)

Ensure that all the class has reached this point and everyone was able to run this simple testing line of code, ask TAs to assist any students that may be stuck.

Once everyone in the class has Amazon SageMaker Studio running, explain to students that as any Jupyter lab interface, they can run their notebooks and custom code in Amazon SageMaker Studio.

Explain to students that now you will show them how to import a local Jupyter notebook into Amazon SageMaker Studio.

Ask your TAs to slack out to students the `monte_carlo.ipynb` Jupyter notebook and the `tickers_data.csv` data file.

Continue the demo by importing the data file into Amazon SageMaker Studio. Click on the "New Folder" icon and create a new folder named `Data`; after creating the folder, import the `tickers_data.csv` file from your local drive.

![Loading a CSV file into Amazon SageMaker Studio](Images/sagemaker_studio_csv.gif)

Next, move to the root folder and import the `monte_carlo.ipynb` Jupyter notebook into Amazon SageMaker Studio.

![Loading a Jupyter notebook into Amazon SageMaker Studio](Images/sagemaker-studio-ipynb.gif)

Continue the demo by opening the Jupyter notebook and selecting the "Python 3 (Data Science)" kernel. Run all the cells of the notebook and explain to students that the code in this notebook runs a Monte Carlo simulation using the tickers data you imported and pure Python code, we are not using jet the built-in algorithms of Amazon SageMaker.

![Running an imported Jupyter notebook in Amazon SageMaker Studio](Images/sagemaker-studio-running-notebook.gif)

Be sure that all the students were able to run this notebook and answer any questions before moving on.

### 2 (old). Instructor Do: Introduction to Unsupervised Learning (10 min)

In this activity, students will be introduced to unsupervised learning and its most relevant applications.

Open the lesson slides and go to the Introduction to Unsupervised Learning section.

Start the presentation by explaining to students that, in general terms, machine learning has two main areas of application: supervised and unsupervised learning.

Students are already familiar with supervised learning algorithms and its applications, highlight to students the main differences between these types of learning.

| Supervised Learning                | Unsupervised Learning                      |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Input data is labeled              | Input data is unlabeled                    |
| Uses training datasets             | Uses just input datasets                   |
| **Goal:** Predict a class or value | **Goal:** Determine patterns or group data |

Start a short facilitated discussion with students. Take one or two answers from the class by asking the following question:

* If unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data, what kind of questions or business problems do you think can we solve?

  **Sample answer:** We can group customers on a retail chain by shopping habits, so we can send customized offers by email or mobile app to increase sales.

  **Sample answer:** Having thousands of transactions per day on credit card operations, it is hard to identify anomalous or fraudulent transactions. We can use unsupervised learning to find patterns among transaction data to identify anomalies and potentially fraudulent transactions.

  **Sample answer:** We can use unsupervised learning to cluster stock data so we can create investment portfolios according to the resulting groups.

As an example, continue with the presentation on the slide titled "How can we understand our customers?" and then move forward by highlighting the following:

* Beyond the typical segmentation variables, such as age, gender, income, or zip code, understanding customers is crucial in every sector.

* Supervised learning is very helpful at predicting the future based on labeled historical data; however, there are often situations where supervised learning is not feasible due to lack of information or lack of training labels.

* Unsupervised learning allows us to cluster data to find hidden or unknown patterns that can be used to understand the customers better. For example, to develop a customized offer that responds to the needs identified in every group.

* The main applications of unsupervised learning are:

  * **Clustering:** It allows us to split the dataset into groups according to similarity automatically. It can be used for customer segmentation and targeting.

  * **Anomaly detection:** Automatically discovers unusual data points in a dataset. It is useful in identifying fraudulent transactions, discovering faulty pieces of hardware, or identifying an outlier caused by a human error during data entry.

* Customer segmentation is one of the most popular applications of unsupervised learning. It is the division of potential customers in a given market into discrete groups.

* Thanks to unsupervised learning algorithms, we can group customers based similarities such as:

  * Customer needs (e.g., a particular product can satisfy some of them)
  * Responses to online marketing channels
  * Buying habits (e.g., best day for buying, weekly spend)

Explain to students that customer segmentation is driving revenue in leading companies such as Netflix and Amazon.

* 75% of Netflix viewer activity is driven by recommendation ([source](http://blog.springtab.com/personalization-examples-netflix/)).

* 35% of Amazonâ€™s sales are generated through their recommendation engine ([source](https://www.martechadvisor.com/articles/customer-experience-2/recommendation-engines-how-amazon-and-netflix-are-winning-the-personalization-battle/)).

* Netflixâ€™s recommendation system saves the company an estimated $1 billion per year through reduced churn ([source](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2843948)).

End the presentation with a closing facilitated discussion. Ask the following questions to students:

* How could a bank use customer segmentation to improve its products?

  **Sample answer:** Instead of having a generic offer for a credit card, a bank could use customer segmentation to offer credit cards according to demographics such as age, geography, gender, generation (e.g., millennials and baby boomers), income level, marital status, etc.

* How could an investment portfolio be improved using customer segmentation?

  **Sample answer:** Using customer segmentation, a portfolio can be categorized by industry, location, revenue, account size, and the number of employees to reveal where risk and opportunity live within the portfolio. These patterns can provide key measurable data for more predictive credit risk management.

Explain to students that we will be learning how to use Scikit-learn and cloud-based tools to implement clustering and customer segmentation.

### 3. Instructor Do: Data Preparation for Unsupervised Learning (10 min)

In this activity, students will learn about the data preparation considerations they should take into account before they start working with unsupervised learning algorithms.

**Files:**

* [01_Ins_Data_Preparation.ipynb](Activities/01-Ins_Data_Prep/Solved/01_Ins_Data_Preparation.ipynb)

* [iris.csv](Activities/01-Ins_Data_Prep/Resources/iris.csv)

* [new_iris_data.csv](Activities/01-Ins_Data_Prep/Resources/new_iris_data.csv)

Explain to students that data preparation for unsupervised learning does not differ too much from the process followed for supervised learning problems.

Explain to the class that, as they already have done in past lessons, they should consider the following data preparation tasks:

1. **Data selection:** Make a good choice of what data is going to be used. It is important to consider what data is available, what data is missing, and what data can be removed.
2. **Data preprocessing:** Organize the selected data by formatting, cleaning, and sampling it.
3. **Data transformation:** Transform the data to a format that eases its treatment and storage for future use (e.g., CSV file, spreadsheet, database).

Highlight to students that the main difference in preparing data for unsupervised learning is that its algorithms don't have any target variable; they only have input features that will be used to find patterns in the data. So, they should take care of selecting features that could help to find those patterns or create groups.

Open the unsolved version of the Jupyter Notebook, live code the demo, and highlight the following:

* To get started with unsupervised learning, [the iris dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) will be used.

* The data preparation workflow is quite similar to what students have been following in the past; once the data is selected, the next step is to load the data into a Pandas DataFrame.

  ![Lading the iris dataset](Images/reading-iris-data.png)

* In coming activities, the `class` of the iris plants will be found using unsupervised learning, so the next step is to remove the `class` column since it is not necessary.

  ![Removing the class column](Images/removing-class-column.png)

Explain to students that since all the variables on the dataset are numerical, there are no additional data preprocessing tasks to do. However, data transformations have to be done when there are categorical data or non-numeric features on the dataset. For example, transforming `male` and `female` categorical values to `0` and `1`.

* Finally, the preprocessed DataFrame is saved on a new `CSV` file for further use.

  ```python
  file_path = Path("../Resources/new_iris_data.csv")
  new_iris_df.to_csv(file_path, index=False)
  ```

Ask the class if there are any further questions before moving to the next activity.

---

### 4. Student Do: Understanding Customers (20 min)

In this activity, students will perform some data preparation tasks on a dataset that contains data from purchases on an e-commerce website made by 200 customers. Students will use this dataset on further activities to find customer segments.

There are some data transformations that should be made to the dataset, so ask TAs to assist students if there are any questions about why the following changes are needed.

* **Annual Income:** This feature should be regularized since it is on a different scale than the other features; dividing by `1000` is the simplest solution.

* **Gender:** The `Gender` should be transformed to a numerical value, in this case, transforming `Male` to `1` and `Female` to `0` is a feasible solution.

* **CustomerID:** Since this column is not relevant to the clustering algorithm, it should be dropped from the DataFrame.

**Instructions:**

* [README.md](Activities/02-Stu_Preparing_Data/README.md)

**Files:**

* [preparing_data.ipynb](Activities/02-Stu_Preparing_Data/Unsolved/preparing_data.ipynb)

* [shopping_data.csv](Activities/02-Stu_Preparing_Data/Resources/shopping_data.csv)

---

### 5. Instructor Do: Review Understanding Customers (10 min)

**Files:**

* [preparing_data.ipynb](Activities/02-Stu_Preparing_Data/Solved/preparing_data.ipynb)

* [shopping_data.csv](Activities/02-Stu_Preparing_Data/Resources/shopping_data.csv)

* [shopping_data_cleaned.csv](Activities/02-Stu_Preparing_Data/Resources/shopping_data_cleaned.csv)

Walkthrough the solution and highlight the following:

* Unsupervised learning algorithms only work with numerical data, so checking data types is an important task to ensure that numerical values were loaded to the DataFrame with the appropriate data type.

  ![Data types check](Images/datatypes-check.png)

* All columns have an appropriate data type, so no adjustments are needed.

* The `CustomerID` column can be dropped; it is not relevant for clustering since it does not denote any relevant characteristic of customer shopping habits.

  ```python
  df_shopping.drop(columns=["CustomerID"], inplace=True)
  ```

* Looking for `null` values and duplicate entries is part of any data preprocessing workflow; there are no `null` values nor duplicates on this DataFrame, so no additional adjustments are needed.

* The `Genre` column is categorical, so it should be transformed into numerical values. Transforming `Male` to `1` and `Female` to `0` is a common practice.

  ```python
  def changeGenre(genre):
    if genre == "Male":
        return 1
    else:
        return 0

  df_shopping["Genre"] = df_shopping["Genre"].apply(changeGenre)
  ```

* The `Annual Income` column is on a different scale than the other columns, so this column should be rescaled. Dividing by `1000` is the simplest approach.

  ```python
  df_shopping["Annual Income"] = df_shopping["Annual Income"] / 1000
  ```

* Finally, the cleaned DataFrame is saved as a `CSV` file for being used in coming activities.

```python
  file_path = Path("../Resources/shopping_data_cleaned.csv")
  df_shopping.to_csv(file_path, index=False)
```

Be sure that there are no questions before moving forward.

### 6. Instructor Do: The K-Means Algorithm (15 min)

In this activity, students will learn how the k-means algorithm works. Use your time wisely to cover the theoretical part, as well as the coding part.

**File:**

* [03_Ins_K-Means.ipynb](Activities/03-Ins_KMeans/Solved/03_Ins_K-Means.ipynb)

Open the lesson slides and move to the K-Means Algorithm section; go through the slides and highlight the following.

* To understand how k-means works, a fictional anecdote is used.

  > Imagine that you are in a room full of spheres (data points), and you want to learn more about them, so you start to observe.
  >
  > You realize that every sphere represents a flower and that axes represent features of flowers. After observing the flowers, you discovered that there are some patterns when you combine the three features.
  >
  > We can see that spheres (data points) with similar features seem to be closer together than data points with dissimilar features. We can use this spatial information to group similar data points together.

Explain to students that k-means is an unsupervised learning algorithm used to identify clusters and solve clustering issues.

Continue on the slides to formally introduce k-means, and highlight the following:

* The k-means algorithm groups the data into `k` clusters, where each piece of data is assigned to a cluster based on some similarity or distance measure to a **centroid**.

* A centroid represents a data point that is the arithmetic mean position of all the points on a cluster.

* At a glance, the k-means algorithm works as follows:

  1. Randomly initialize the `k` starting centroids.
  2. Each data point is assigned to its nearest centroid.
  3. The centroids are recomputed as the mean of the data points assigned to the respective cluster.
  4. Repeat steps `1` through `3` until the stopping criteria is triggered.

* One of the key tasks using k-means is to find the best number for `k`. In other words, `k` determines how many clusters or groups best represent the data.

* The **elbow curve** is the most common method used to figure out the best value of `k`.

* On the elbow curve, the `x` axis is the value of `k`, while the `y` axis is the value of some objective function.

* The **inertia** that is the sum of squared distances of samples to their closest cluster center is commonly used as an objective function.

* Visually, the best number for `k` is the `k` value where the curve turns like an elbow.

* Analytically, using the inertia, we choose as the best `k` the `k` value where adding more clusters only marginally decreases the inertia.

Reassure students that while this may sound complex, k-means is actually quite simple to implement using Python.

Close the presentation, open the starter unsolved Jupyter Notebook and live code the demo by highlighting the following:

* This demo uses the data from the iris dataset presented before.

* The k-means algorithm is imported from the `sklearn` library.

  ```python
  from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
  ```

* After the data is loaded in a DataFrame, the first step is to create an instance of the k-means algorithm and initialize it with the desired number of clusters (K). For this demo, we will use `k = 3`, since we already know we have three classes of iris plants.

  ```python
  model = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=5)
  ```

* Once the model instance is created, the next step is to fit the model with the unlabeled data. When the model is being trained (fit to the data), the k-means algorithm will iteratively look for the best centroid for each of the `k` clusters.

  ```python
  model.fit(df_iris)
  ```

* After the model is fit, the corresponding cluster for every iris plant in the dataset can be found using the `predict()` method.

  ![K-Means predictions](Images/kmeans-predictions-iris.png)

Explain to students that, as they can see, three classes were found, labeled as `0`, `1`, and `2`. Make it clear to the class that naming classes is part of the job done by a subject matter expert; the k-means algorithm is just able to identify how many clusters are in the data and label them with numbers.

Continue the demo by adding a new column to the DataFrame with the predicted classes.

![Adding predicted classes](Images/adding-classes-column.png)

* Visualizing the clusters helps to understand how they are arranged graphically. In this case, we actually have too many features to represent visually, but we can take two or three of them to plot the clusters.

  | Two features                          | Three Features                        |
  | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
  | ![2 Features](Images/plotting-2d.png) | ![3 Features](Images/plotting-3d.png) |

Continue the live coding demo by showing students how the best value for `k` can be found; highlight the following:

* Two lists are created to store the values for the `inertia` and to define how many values of `k` we want to try. Ten values of `k` is normally a good number to start.

  ```python
  inertia = []
  k = list(range(1, 11))
  ```

* A `for-loop` is defined to fit the k-means model with the data from `df_iris` and a number of clusters ranging from 1 to 10. The `inertia` is fetched in each iteration to be compared to the elbow curve.

  ```python
  # Looking for the best k
  for i in k:
      km = KMeans(n_clusters=i, random_state=0)
      km.fit(df_iris)
      inertia.append(km.inertia_)
  ```

* The elbow curve is plotted using `hvPlot`, so a DataFrame is created.

  ```python
  elbow_data = {
    "k": k,
    "inertia": inertia
  }
  df_elbow = pd.DataFrame(elbow_data)
  df_elbow.hvplot.line(x="k", y="inertia", title="Elbow Curve", xticks=k)
  ```

* As can be seen on the elbow curve, visually the best value for `k` is `3`.

### 7. Student Do: Customer Segments for E-Commerce (20 min)

In this activity, students will identify the best number of clusters on a customer clustering scenario using the elbow curve. Next, students will use k-means to cluster data and make conclusions about the obtained results.

**Instructions:**

* [README.md](Activities/04-Stu_K_Means_In_Action/README.md)

**Files:**

* [k_means_in_action.ipynb](Activities/04-Stu_K_Means_In_Action/Unsolved/k_means_in_action.ipynb)

* [shopping_data_cleaned.csv](Activities/04-Stu_K_Means_In_Action/Resources/shopping_data_cleaned.csv)

---

### 8. Instructor Do: Review Customer Segments for E-Commerce (10 min)

**Files:**

* [k_means_in_action.ipynb](Activities/04-Stu_K_Means_In_Action/Solved/k_means_in_action.ipynb)

* [shopping_data_cleaned.csv](Activities/04-Stu_K_Means_In_Action/Resources/shopping_data_cleaned.csv)

Walkthrough the solution and highlight the following:

* This activity uses the customer shopping data that was preprocessed earlier.

    ```python
    file_path = Path("../Resources/shopping_data_cleaned.csv")
    df_shopping = pd.read_csv(file_path)
    ```

* The elbow curve is used to find the best value for `k`. A `for-loop` is used to loop 10 times, fitting the k-means model and fetching the `inertia` to create the plot.

    ```python
    inertia = []
    k = list(range(1, 11))

    # Calculate the inertia for the range ok k values
    for i in k:
        km = KMeans(n_clusters=i, random_state=0)
        km.fit(df_shopping)
        inertia.append(km.inertia_)
    ```

* The elbow curve is created using `hvPlot`.

    ```python
    elbow_data = {"k": k, "inertia": inertia}
    df_elbow = pd.DataFrame(elbow_data)
    df_elbow.hvplot.line(x="k", y="inertia", xticks=k, title="Elbow Curve")
    ```

Explain to students that, after observing the elbow curve, they can conclude that the best two values for `k` can be `5` and `6`, since at those points the elbow shape starts.

![elbow curve](Images/elbow-curve-customers.png)

* The `get_clusters()` function, is a mechanism to encapsulate the k-means clustering algorithm to be reused. The value of `k` and the `data` where the clusters are going to be identified are passed as parameters.

    ```python
    def get_clusters(k, data):
        # Initialize the K-Means model
        model = KMeans(n_clusters=k, random_state=0)

        # Fit the model
        model.fit(data)

        # Predict clusters
        predictions = model.predict(data)

        # Create return DataFrame with predicted clusters
        data["class"] = model.labels_

        return data
    ```

* A visual analysis of using k-means with `k=5` and `k=6` is done by creating a 2-D scatter plot, as well as a 3-D, scatter plot.

| Plot Type       | `k=5`                                       | `k=6`                                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 2D Scatter plot | ![2D Scatter k=5](Images/2d-scatter-k5.png) | ![2D Scatter k=6](Images/2d-scatter-k6.png) |
| 3D Scatter plot | ![3D Scatter k=5](Images/3d-scatter-k5.png) | ![3D Scatter k=5](Images/3d-scatter-k6.png) |

Explain that even though we have more features than we can plot in two or three dimensions, it is still helpful to show the graphs.

* After analyzing the plots, it can be concluded that using `k=6`, a more meaningful segmentation of customers can be done as follows:

  * _Cluster 1_: Medium income, low annual spend
  * _Cluster 2_: Low income, low annual spend
  * _Cluster 3_: High income, high annual spend
  * _Cluster 4_: Low income, high annual spend
  * _Cluster 5_: Medium income, low annual spend
  * _Cluster 6_: Very high income, high annual spend

* Having defined these clusters, we can formulate marketing strategies relevant to each cluster aimed to increase revenue.

Encourage one or two students to share their conclusions, ask for any remaining questions, and move forward.

### 10. Instructor Do: Speeding up Machine-Learning Algorithms with PCA (10 min)

In this activity, students will learn how to use principal component analysis as a technique to speed up machine-learning algorithms by reducing the number of features.

**Files:**

* [05_Ins_PCA.ipynb](Activities/05-Ins_PCA/Solved/05_Ins_PCA.ipynb)

Explain to students that principal component analysis (PCA), is a statistical technique to speed up machine-learning algorithms when the number of input features (or dimensions) is too high. Explain to students that PCA reduces the number of dimensions by transforming a large set of variables into a smaller one that contains most of the information in the original large set.

Open the unsolved Jupyter Notebook, live code the demo, and highlight the following:

* There are two libraries that should be imported from `sklearn` to use PCA: `StandardScaler` and `PCA`.

  ```python
  from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
  from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
  ```

* The previously preprocessed version of the iris dataset is used to explain how to apply PCA.

  ![The iris dataset without target class](Images/iris-dataset-no-targets.png)

* There are four features in the iris dataset with values on different scales. The first step toward using PCA is to standardize the features' values. The `StandardScaler` library is used to do this.

  ![Using StandardScaler](Images/using-standardscaler.png)

* Once the features are standardized, PCA can be used to reduce the number of features in the dataset. First, a PCA model should be created specifying the final number of features in the `n_components` parameter. In this demo, the features are reduced from `4` to `2`.

  ```python
  pca = PCA(n_components=2)
  ```

* After creating the PCA model, we apply dimensionality reduction on the scaled dataset.

  ```python
  iris_pca = pca.fit_transform(iris_scaled)
  ```

Tell students that after dimensionality reduction, we get as a result a smaller set of dimensions called **principal components**. There isnâ€™t a particular meaning assigned to each principal component; the new components are just the two main dimensions of variation that contains most of the information in the original dataset.

* The resulting principal components, are transformed into a DataFrame to be used next to fit the k-means algorithm. You can see that principal component values have no direct relation with the values in the original dataset. They can be seen as a reduced representation of the original data.

  ![PCA Data](Images/pca-df.png)

Explain to students that dimensionality reductions imply a loss of accuracy; however, the trick is to sacrifice a little accuracy for simplicity. Smaller datasets are easier to explore and visualize. They ease data analysis and speed up machine-learning algorithms without extraneous variables to process.

* To know how much information can be attributed to each principal component, the explained variances are used.

  ![Explained variance](Images/explained-variance.png)

Explain to students that in this demo, after using the attribute `explained_variance_ratio_`, they can see that the first principal component contains `72.77%` of the variance, and the second principal component contains `23.03%` of the variance. Both components together contain `95.80%` of the information.

* The elbow curve is generated using the principal components data. You can see that the resulting best value for `k` is `3`. Despite some accuracy loss due to dimensionality reduction, the results are still good enough.

  ![PCA Elbow Curve](Images/pca-elbow-curve.png)

* The k-means algorithm is used to predict the clusters for the iris data. But now, the principal components data is used with `k=3`.

  ```python
  # Initialize the K-Means model
  model = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=0)

  # Fit the model
  model.fit(df_iris_pca)

  # Predict clusters
  predictions = model.predict(df_iris_pca)
  ```

* Finally, the clusters are plotted. Now they are easier to analyze since we have only two features.

  ![Clusters plot](Images/pca-clusters-plot.png)

### 11. Student Do: PCA in Action (20 min)

In this activity, students will use PCA to reduce the dimensions of the consumers' shopping dataset.

**Instructions:**

* [README.md](Activities/06-Stu_PCA/README.md)

**Files:**

* [06_Stu_PCA.ipynb](Activities/06-Stu_PCA/Unsolved/06_Stu_PCA.ipynb)

---

### 12. Instructor Do: Review PCA in Action (10 min)

**Files:**

* [06_Stu_PCA.ipynb](Activities/06-Stu_PCA/Solved/06_Stu_PCA.ipynb)

Walkthrough the solution and highlight the following:

* After using PCA, the features' values on the `df_shopping` DataFrame are standardized using the `StandardScaler` library from `sklearn`.

  ```python
  shopping_scaled = StandardScaler().fit_transform(df_shopping)
  ```

* PCA is initially used by reducing the number of features from `4` to `2`.

  ```python
  # Initialize PCA model
  pca = PCA(n_components=2)

  # Get two principal components for the data.
  shopping_pca = pca.fit_transform(shopping_scaled)
  ```

Tell students that, when they fetch the explained variance, the first principal component will contain `33.7%` of the variance, and the second principal component will contain `26.2%` of the variance. Since we have `59.9%` of the information in the original dataset, it is worth to explore increasing the number of principal components up to three to verify if this ratio improves.

![Explained variance with two PCs](Images/explained-variance-2pcs.png)

* After PCA is applied defining three principal components, the explained variance value improves. This preserves `83.1%` of the information in the original dataset, so we can conclude that using three principal components is a better approach to reduce the dimensions in this case.

  ![Explained variance with three PCs](Images/explained-variance-3pcs.png)

* The k-means algorithm is fit with the principal components data to predict the clusters. A value of `k=6` is used, as this was the best value in the previous exercise using the elbow curve.

  ```python
  # Initialize the K-Means model
  model = KMeans(n_clusters=6, random_state=0)

  # Fit the model
  model.fit(df_shopping_pca)

  # Predict clusters
  predictions = model.predict(df_shopping_pca)

  # Add the predicted class columns
  df_shopping_pca["class"] = model.labels_
  ```

* Since we decided that three principal components were the best approach, a 3-D scatter plot is created with Plotly Express to represent the clusters visually.

  ![Clusters plot](Images/pca-data-plot.png)

Explain to students that the power of PCA to speed up machine-learning algorithms is more noticeable when you are dealing with a dataset that has tens or hundreds of features. For datasets up to ten features, PCA adds value to simplify data analysis and visualization.

Answer any questions before moving on.
