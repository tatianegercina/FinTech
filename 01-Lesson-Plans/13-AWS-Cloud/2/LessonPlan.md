## 13.2 Lesson Plan: Deploying ML Models with SageMaker

### Overview

In today's class, students will be introduced to some Amazon Web Services (AWS) tools and will learn how to leverage some cloud computing services for machine learning using Amazon SageMaker.

### Class Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Describe the pros and cons of using cloud services to deploy machine learning models.

* Orchestrate a cloud solution by combining different AWS services.

* Understand how Amazon SageMaker works and how it can be used to deploy machine learning models.

### Instructor Notes

* This lesson introduces new content rapidly. Students may express frustration at learning new cloud technologies. Remind students that while the learning curve may be steep at first, AWS and Cloud experience is highly sought-after and well worth the effort required to become comfortable with it.

* **Important!** Slack out the disclaimer for [AWS Free Tier](../Supplemental/AWS-Free-Tier.pdf) services prior to class. Take some time at the beginning of class to explain that while we are only using free tier services in class, students should review this documentation in order to avoid accidentally incurring charges.

* Note that in the past, AWS content has appeared differently for some instructional teams. It seems that AWS does A/B testing on their UI. If your AWS views _donâ€™t_ match up with the views in the lesson plan, check that you've pulled the latest updates from github or look in the Slack Instructional Team channel for announcements regarding this.

* Check prior to class that all students has a an AWS account and are able to login.

* Today's class should be a fun one. Students will put together many different technologies covered so far and learn how they can interact with cloud services.

* There are a few activities that require setup. Have the class follow along and ask questions as you go.

* Have your TAs keep track of time with the [Time Tracker](TimeTracker.xlsx).

### 1. Instructor Do: Welcome Class (5 min)

Welcome class to day 2 of Unit 13, this should be a fun one since students will go deeper on using AWS to deploy machine learning models.

Explain students that along this unit, we will use the free tier of AWS, as well as, the trial period for some of the services. Slack out the following resources to be used as reference to understand how the free offer of AWS works.

* [AWS Free Tier Supplemental](../Supplemental/AWS-Free-Tier.pdf)

* [AWS Free Tier Documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Categories=categories%23ai-ml)

Open the [AWS Free Tier Supplemental](../Supplemental/AWS-Free-Tier.md) and briefly explain to students the limits we will have for the services they will learn in this unit.

| Amazon SageMaker (Free Trial)                                                    | Amazon Lex (12 Months Free)       | AWS Lambda (Always Free)                              | Amazon S3 (12 Months Free) |

Answer any questions before moving on.

### 2. Instructor Do: Creating an Administrator user on IAM (10 min)

In this activity, students will learn how to create an `administrator` user using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service. This will add some extra security when working on AWS.

Explain to students, that a common best practice, is to avoid using the principal or _root_ user to manage their AWS account. This principal user is the one they used to create their AWS account. Instead, a new user for each person that requires administrator access should be created using the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service.

Open the [AWS Managemet Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com) using your _root_ user, and show students how to create a new user on IAM as follows.

* Look for the IAM service on the _Find Services_ search box, type `iam` and click on `IAM` service.

  ![Create an administrator IAM user - Step 1](Images/iam-user-1.png)

* In the left pane menu, choose the _Users_ option and click on the _Add user_ button.

  ![Create an administrator IAM user - Step 2](Images/iam-user-2.png)

* On the _Add user_ page, fill out the details of the new `administrator` user and click on the _Next: Permissions_ button to continue.

  * **User name:** `administrator`
  * **Access type:** Select the _Programmatic access_ and _AWS Management Console access_ boxes.
  * **Console password:** Choose _Custom password_ and type your own password.
  * **Require password reset:** Unselect this box.

  ![Create an administrator IAM user - Step 3](Images/iam-user-3.png)

* On the _Set permissions_ page, choose _Add user to group_ and click on the _Create group_ button.

  ![Create an administrator IAM user - Step 4](Images/iam-user-4.png)

* In the _Create group_ dialog box, type `Administrators` on the _Group name_ textbox.

* Choose _Filter policies_, and then choose _AWS managed - job function_ to filter the table contents.

  ![Create an administrator IAM user - Step 5](Images/iam-user-5.png)

* In the policy list, select the check box for _AdministratorAccess_. Then choose the _Create group_ button.

  ![Create an administrator IAM user - Step 6](Images/iam-user-6.png)

* After creating the group, select the check box for your new group. Choose Refresh if necessary to see the group in the list.

  ![Create an administrator IAM user - Step 7](Images/iam-user-7.png)

* Click on the _Next: Tags_ button to continue.

* On the _Next: Tags_ page, leave the defaults and click on the _Next: Review_ button to continue.

  ![Create an administrator IAM user - Step 8](Images/iam-user-8.png)

* Review the list of group memberships to be added to the new user. When you are ready to proceed, click on the _Create user_ button.

  ![Create an administrator IAM user - Step 9](Images/iam-user-9.png)

* Once the user is created, download the user's credentials by clicking on the _Download .csv_ button. Keep those credentials safe.

  ![Create an administrator IAM user - Step 10](Images/iam-user-10.png)

Enable access to billing data for the IAM admin user as follows:

* On the navigation bar, choose your account name, and then choose My Account.

  ![Create an administrator IAM user - Step 11](Images/iam-user-11.png)

* Scroll down to the _IAM User and Role Access to Billing Information_ section, and click on the _Edit_ option.

  ![Create an administrator IAM user - Step 12](Images/iam-user-12.png)

* Select the check box to _Activate IAM Access_ and choose _Update_.

  ![Create an administrator IAM user - Step 13](Images/iam-user-13.png)

Sign-out from your session, open the `CSV` file with the new `administrator` user credentials and login into the AWS Management Console using the user's URL and password. Tell students, that from now on, they should avoid using their _root user_ and work with this new admin user instead.

Answer any questions before moving on.

### 6. Instructor Do: Create and Deploy a Machine Learning Model in Amazon SageMaker (15 min)

In this activity, students will learn how a machine learning model is created, trained, deployed and evaluated in Amazon SageMaker.

**Files:**

* [rainfall_forecast.ipynb](Activities/03-Ins_SageMaker_Deployment/Unsolved/rainfall_forecast.ipynb)

* [x_austin_final.csv](Activities/03-Ins_SageMaker_Deployment/Resources/x_austin_final.csv)

* [y_austin_final.csv](Activities/03-Ins_SageMaker_Deployment/Resources/y_austin_final.csv)

Explain students, that now, you are going to demo how they can deploy a machine learning model using the built-in models of Amazon SageMaker.

Tell students that in this demo, you are going to deploy a linear regression model to predict the amount of rain that will fall in Austin given the average temperature in Fahrenheit degrees.

Start the demo by opening the the Jupyter lab UI at your Amazon SageMaker instance, and create a new folder called `Data`.

![Deploy SageMaker Model - step 1](Images/deploy-sagemaker-1.png)

Open the `Data` folder, and upload the following `CSV` files:

* `x_austin_final.csv`, this file contains historical weather conditions in Austin, Texas along 1319 days.

* `y_austin_final.cvs`, this file contains the precipitations sum in inches in Austin, Texas along 1319 days.

![Deploy SageMaker Model - step 2](Images/deploy-sagemaker-2.png)

Navigate to the main folder on Jupyter lab, and import the the unsolved version of the Jupyter notebook to your Amazon SageMaker notebook instance, live code the demo by highlighting the following:

* In the `Initial imports` section, some well known libraries are imported. `sklearn` library is used to split the dataset in training and testing set, as well as to evaluate the model.

  ```python
  import os
  import io
  import json
  import numpy as np
  import pandas as pd
  from path import Path
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
  from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score
  ```

* To use Amazon SageMaker, the following libraries are needed.

  ```python
  import sagemaker
  import sagemaker.amazon.common as smac
  from sagemaker.predictor import csv_serializer, json_deserializer
  from sagemaker import get_execution_role
  from sagemaker.amazon.amazon_estimator import get_image_uri
  import boto3
  ```

* Along with the `sagemaker` modules, the `boto3` library is imported, this is [AWS SDK for Python](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html).

### 7. Students Do: Deploying a Housing Price Prediction Model in Amazon SageMaker (20 min)

In this activity, students will calculate a linear regression model to predict the price of a house using the Boston Housing dataset and the SageMaker built-in `Linear Learner` algorithm.

**Instructions:**

* [README.md](Activities/03-Stu_Housing_Price/README.md)

**Files**:

* [boston-housing-regression.ipynb](Activities/03-Stu_Housing_Price/Unsolved/boston-housing-regression.ipynb)

---

### 8. Instructor Do: Deploying a Housing Price Prediction Model in Amazon SageMaker (10 min)

**Files**:

* [boston-housing-regression.ipynb](Activities/02-Stu_Housing_Linear_Regression/Solved/boston-housing-regression.ipynb)

Reassure students that it's okay if this was challenging. Amazon SageMaker APIs have a learning curve, as do other AWS resources, along with Machine Learning in general; comment students they will get a lot of practice with AWS Today!

Walk through the solution and highlight the following:

* The date is fetched and analyzed to become familiar with it.

* The data is split into _Test_ and _Train_ datasets and converted into to the [RecordIO-wrapped ProtoBuf format](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/cdf-inference.html) used by Amazon SageMaker's algorithms.

* The prepared and formatted data is uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket.

* The model is trained using a linear learner algorithm using the data stored in Amazon S3.

* The trained model is deployed on an Amazon SageMaker instance.

* Predictions are performed and the model's performance is scored.

### 10. Instructor Do: Pros and Cons of Deploying Machine Learning Models with Amazon SageMaker (10 min)

Lead and facilitate a discussion around deploying models in Amazon SageMaker and why a RESTful ML API is useful.

Have students share their opinions with the class and bring up the following points:

**Pros:**

* Data storage capacity: By using an Amazon S3 bucket to store the data, we could have trained a model on multiple terabytes of data, or a lot more space than would otherwise have fit in our personal computer.

* Hardware / GPU: By using different Amazon SageMaker instances to train our model, we can access compute power including GPU capabilities, making powerful hardware available to us as required.

* Cost: Using AWS resources, we only pay for what we use, we'll turn off everything before ending the class and not incur in further charges.

* Availability: By deploying our model to another Amazon SageMaker instance, we have make the prediction functionality available 24/7 through a secured endpoint to an application or to be consumed by others without having to make our computer available.

* RESTful API: As learned in previous units, APIs provide a standard mechanism to access data, our ML API can be consumed through apps and other channels in a simple form while remaining secure and allowing other constraints (for example: authentication, authorization, rate limiting, etc.).

**Cons:**

* Data privacy / security: By uploading data to a third party, you are trusting your data on them. Certain kinds of data are subject to compliance and regulatory constraints.

* Visibility: You won't have oversight on AWS internal handling of your data and infrastructure.

* Availability: Although there are SLAs in place, AWS (and any other cloud providers) can and have suffered outages at times, causing data unavailability.

### 11. Students Do: Credit Risk Evaluation with Amazon SageMaker (20 min)

In this activity, students will train and deploy a binary classification model to predict the *credit risk* of a person using the [German Credit Risk dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/statlog+(german+credit+data)) and the SageMaker built-in `Linear Learner` algorithm.

This activity will require use of an AWS SageMaker notebook instance, the unsolved notebook will guide students through the process and indicate what the missing code snippets are.

**Instructions:**

* [README.md](Activities/11-Stu_Credit_Risk_Classification/README.md)

**Files**:

* [credit-risk-classification.ipynb](Activities/11-Stu_Credit_Risk_Classification/Unsolved/credit-risk-classification.ipynb)
* [german_credit_data.csv](Activities/11-Stu_Credit_Risk_Classification/Resources/german_credit_data.csv)


---

### 12. Instructor Do: Review CCredit Risk Evaluation with Amazon SageMaker (10 min)

* Open JupyterLab in your AWS SageMaker notebook instance.

* Upload the dataset: [german_credit_data.csv](Activities/11-Stu_Credit_Risk_Classification/Resources/german_credit_data.csv)

* Upload the solved notebook: [credit-risk-classification.ipynb](Activities/11-Stu_Credit_Risk_Classification/Solved/credit-risk-classification.ipynb)

* Walk-through the solved notebook, cell by cell, highlighting the following points:
  * This activity is similar the the previous *Housing Price Prediction*, however rather than `linear regression` we're calculating a `logistic regression` to perform a `binary classification`.
  * The output of the model prediction is a binary label (0, 1): "Good" or "Bad" Credit Risk.
  * Despite using a "curated" dataset, we still need to perform some data preparation tasks: *split*, *hot-encode* and *scale* the input features.
  * Similar to the *housing price prediction*, we use the AWS SageMaker built-in `linear-lerner` algorithm, but changing the hyper-parameter `predictor_type` to `'binary_classifier'`
  * Lastly, for our model evaluation, besides the accuracy score, we use a confusion matrix to get a quick sense of the model's true-positive/negative and false-positive/negative prediction combinations.

Answer any remaining questions before moving on the the next activity.

### 13. Instructor Do: Delete Notebook Instance (10 min)

Show students how to delete their SageMaker notebook instance so that no billing charges are incurred for it after class.

* From the SageMaker console, use the left pane menu and visit: Notebook -> [Notebook instances](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/home?region=us-east-1#/notebook-instances)

* Select the the Notebook Instance (or follow this process for all) on the left circular dot.
![Notebook Instance list](Images/notebook-instance-list.png)

* Once selected, click on the right `Actions` menu and select `Stop`.

* Refresh the page and wait for the instance `Status` to change to `Stopped`.
![Notebook Instance actions](Images/notebook-instance-actions.png)

* Select the instance again, click on `Actions` and select `Delete` then confirm delete.
![Notebook Instance delete](Images/notebook-confirm-delete.png)

* At the end of the lesson, the notebook instances list should be empty and state: "There are currently no resources.", otherwise charges will be incurred for any remaining active instances.

* If for any reason you changed regions during class, make sure you delete any notebook instances in all regions

* Lastly, go to S3 <https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com> and remove the buckets created for the activity.

Answer any questions before ending class.
