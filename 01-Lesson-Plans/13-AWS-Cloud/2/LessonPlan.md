## 13.2 Lesson Plan: Deploying ML Models with SageMaker

### Overview

In today's class, students will be introduced to some Amazon Web Services (AWS) tools and will learn how to leverage some cloud computing services for machine learning using Amazon SageMaker.

### Class Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Describe the pros and cons of using cloud services to deploy machine learning models.

* Orchestrate a cloud solution by combining different AWS services.

* Understand how Amazon SageMaker works and how it can be used to deploy machine learning models.

### Instructor Notes

* This lesson introduces new content rapidly. Students may express frustration at learning new cloud technologies. Remind students that while the learning curve may be steep at first, AWS and Cloud experience is highly sought-after and well worth the effort required to become comfortable with it.

* **Important!** Slack out the disclaimer for [AWS Free Tier](../Supplemental/AWS-Free-Tier.pdf) services prior to class. Take some time at the beginning of class to explain that while we are only using free tier services in class, students should review this documentation in order to avoid accidentally incurring charges.

* Note that in the past, AWS content has appeared differently for some instructional teams. It seems that AWS does A/B testing on their UI. If your AWS views _donâ€™t_ match up with the views in the lesson plan, check that you've pulled the latest updates from github or look in the Slack Instructional Team channel for announcements regarding this.

* Check prior to class that all students has a an AWS account and are able to login.

* Today's class should be a fun one. Students will put together many different technologies covered so far and learn how they can interact with cloud services.

* There are a few activities that require setup. Have the class follow along and ask questions as you go.

* Have your TAs keep track of time with the [Time Tracker](TimeTracker.xlsx).

### 1. Instructor Do: Welcome Class (5 min)

Welcome class to day 2 of Unit 13, this should be a fun one since students will go deeper on using AWS to deploy machine learning models.

Explain students that along this unit, we will use the free tier of AWS, as well as, the trial period for some of the services. Slack out the following resources to be used as reference to understand how the free offer of AWS works.

* [AWS Free Tier Supplemental](../Supplemental/AWS-Free-Tier.pdf)

* [AWS Free Tier Documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Categories=categories%23ai-ml)

Open the [AWS Free Tier Supplemental](../Supplemental/AWS-Free-Tier.md) and briefly explain to students the limits we will have for the services they will learn in this unit.

| Amazon SageMaker (Free Trial)                                                    | Amazon Lex (12 Months Free)       | AWS Lambda (Always Free)                              | Amazon S3 (12 Months Free) |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `250` hours per month of `t2.medium` notebook usage for the first **two months** | `10,000` text requests per month  | `1,000,000` free requests per month                   | `5` GB of Standard Storage |

Answer any questions before moving on.

### 2. Instructor Do: Creating an Administrator user on IAM (10 min)

In this activity, students will learn how to create an `administrator` user using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service. This will add some extra security when working on AWS.

Explain to students, that a common best practice, is to avoid using the principal or _root_ user to manage their AWS account. This principal user is the one they used to create their AWS account. Instead, a new user for each person that requires administrator access should be created using the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service.

Open the [AWS Managemet Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com) using your _root_ user, and show students how to create a new user on IAM as follows.

* Look for the IAM service on the _Find Services_ search box, type `iam` and click on `IAM` service.

  ![Create an administrator IAM user - Step 1](Images/iam-user-1.png)

* In the left pane menu, choose the _Users_ option and click on the _Add user_ button.

  ![Create an administrator IAM user - Step 2](Images/iam-user-2.png)

* On the _Add user_ page, fill out the details of the new `administrator` user and click on the _Next: Permissions_ button to continue.

  * **User name:** `administrator`
  * **Access type:** Select the _Programmatic access_ and _AWS Management Console access_ boxes.
  * **Console password:** Choose _Custom password_ and type your own password.
  * **Require password reset:** Unselect this box.

  ![Create an administrator IAM user - Step 3](Images/iam-user-3.png)

* On the _Set permissions_ page, choose _Add user to group_ and click on the _Create group_ button.

  ![Create an administrator IAM user - Step 4](Images/iam-user-4.png)

* In the _Create group_ dialog box, type `Administrators` on the _Group name_ textbox.

* Choose _Filter policies_, and then choose _AWS managed - job function_ to filter the table contents.

  ![Create an administrator IAM user - Step 5](Images/iam-user-5.png)

* In the policy list, select the check box for _AdministratorAccess_. Then choose the _Create group_ button.

  ![Create an administrator IAM user - Step 6](Images/iam-user-6.png)

* After creating the group, select the check box for your new group. Choose Refresh if necessary to see the group in the list.

  ![Create an administrator IAM user - Step 7](Images/iam-user-7.png)

* Click on the _Next: Tags_ button to continue.

* On the _Next: Tags_ page, leave the defaults and click on the _Next: Review_ button to continue.

  ![Create an administrator IAM user - Step 8](Images/iam-user-8.png)

* Review the list of group memberships to be added to the new user. When you are ready to proceed, click on the _Create user_ button.

  ![Create an administrator IAM user - Step 9](Images/iam-user-9.png)

* Once the user is created, download the user's credentials by clicking on the _Download .csv_ button. Keep those credentials safe.

  ![Create an administrator IAM user - Step 10](Images/iam-user-10.png)

Enable access to billing data for the IAM admin user as follows:

* On the navigation bar, choose your account name, and then choose My Account.

  ![Create an administrator IAM user - Step 11](Images/iam-user-11.png)

* Scroll down to the _IAM User and Role Access to Billing Information_ section, and click on the _Edit_ option.

  ![Create an administrator IAM user - Step 12](Images/iam-user-12.png)

* Select the check box to _Activate IAM Access_ and choose _Update_.

  ![Create an administrator IAM user - Step 13](Images/iam-user-13.png)

Sign-out from your session, open the `CSV` file with the new `administrator` user credentials and login into the AWS Management Console using the user's URL and password. Tell students, that from now on, they should avoid using their _root user_ and work with this new admin user instead.

Answer any questions before moving on.

### 5. Everyone Do: Create an Amazon SageMaker Notebook Instance (20 min)

In this activity, students will learn how to create an instance of Amazon SageMaker, and how to use Jupyter notebooks on the AWS cloud.

Comment to students that you will demo how to create an Amazon SageMaker Notebook Instance, ask them to follow your steps as you move along the demo. Ask TAs to assist students if they get stuck along the process.

Login into your _AWS Management Console_ using your admin user, tell students that the first component that Amazon SageMaker requires is an [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3) bucket to store data to feed machine learning models, or to store prediction results.

To create an Amazon S3 bucket, follow the next steps:

* On the _Find Services_ search box, type `s3` and select the _S3_ service from the list.

  ![Creating an Amazon SageMaker instance - step 1](Images/sagemaker-1.png)

* On the Amazon S3 console, click on the _Create bucket_ button.

  ![Creating an Amazon SageMaker instance - step 2](Images/sagemaker-2.png)

* Fill the following details on the _Create button_ window.

  * **Section: Name and region**
    * _Bucket name:_ `sagemaker-<CURRENT-DATE+TIME>` (for example: `sagemaker-20190903-1026`)
    * _Region:_ `US West (Oregon)` (S3 and SageMaker instance regions should be the same)
    * Click: _Next_
    ![Creating an Amazon SageMaker instance - step 3](Images/sagemaker-3.png)
  * **Section: Configure options**

    ![Creating an Amazon SageMaker instance - step 12](Images/sagemaker-12.png)
    * _Root access:_ Be sure that the `Enable - Give users root access to the notebook` option is selected. Tell students, that this option is less safe but allows more control over the instance.
    ![Creating an Amazon SageMaker instance - step 13](Images/sagemaker-13.png)

* Scroll down, and click on the _Create notebook instance_ button to continue. Comment to students, that the creations process takes few minutes to finish.

  ![Creating an Amazon SageMaker instance - step 14](Images/sagemaker-14.png)

While the notebook instance is being created, comment to students that AWS charges for these and most resources as they are created, event when not in use, this instance is billed for by the second until it's turned off and deleted. Students will learn how to delete these resources later on Today's class.

* Once the notebook instance status is _InService_, it's ready to be used; on the _Actions_ column, click on `Open JupyterLab` to continue.

  ![Creating an Amazon SageMaker instance - step 15](Images/sagemaker-15.png)

* After few seconds you will see the Jupyter Lab UI, comment to students that this notebook is running on the AWS Cloud.

  ![Creating an Amazon SageMaker instance - step 16](Images/sagemaker-16.png)

* On the new notebook, code a hello world in Python in the first cell to test. Be sure all the class has reach this point before moving forward.

  ![Creating an Amazon SageMaker instance - step 17](Images/sagemaker-17.png)

Comment to students, that it's possible to code a Jupyter notebook from scratch on this Amazon SageMaker's notebook instance, but also, you can open an existing Jupyter notebook. Slack out to students the `monte_carlo.ipynb` starter file, and continue the demo as follows.

* This demo code, runs a Monte Carlo simulation that uses the IEX API, so ask students to have their API key at hand.

* In your Amazon SageMaker notebook instance, in left icon menu, click on the _Upload_ icon (arrow up) and select the `monte_carlo.ipynb` notebook to upload.

  ![Creating an Amazon SageMaker instance - step 18](Images/sagemaker-18.png)

* Open the `monte_carlo.ipynb` notebook. You'll probably see the message: `Select Kernel` or `Kernel not found`, select `conda_python3` and click on `Select` or `Set Kernel` to continue.

  ![Creating an Amazon SageMaker instance - step 19](Images/sagemaker-19.png)

* Run all the cells on the notebook, comment to students that now this notebook is going to run on the AWS cloud using Amazon SageMaker.

### 6. Students Do: Housing Price Prediction on SageMaker (20 min)

In this activity, students will calculate a linear regression model to predict the price of a house using the Boston Housing dataset and the SageMaker built-in `Linear Learner` algorithm.

**Instructions:**

* [README.md](Activities/03-Stu_Housing_Price/README.md)

**Files**:

* [boston-housing-regression.ipynb](Activities/03-Stu_Housing_Price/Unsolved/boston-housing-regression.ipynb)

---

### 7. Instructor Do: Review Housing Price Prediction on SageMaker (10 min)

**Files**:

* [boston-housing-regression.ipynb](Activities/02-Stu_Housing_Linear_Regression/Solved/boston-housing-regression.ipynb)

Reassure students that it's okay if this was challenging. Amazon SageMaker APIs have a learning curve, as do other AWS resources, along with Machine Learning in general; comment students they will get a lot of practice with AWS Today!

Walk through the solution and highlight the following:

* The date is fetched and analyzed to become familiar with it.

* The data is split into _Test_ and _Train_ datasets and converted into to the [ProtoBuf format](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) used by Amazon SageMaker's algorithms.

* The prepared and formatted data is uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket.

* The model is trained using a linear learner algorithm using the data stored in Amazon S3.

* The trained model is deployed on an Amazon SageMaker instance.

* Predictions are performed and the model's performance is scored.

### 9. Instructor Do: Pros and Cons of Deploying Machine Learning Models with Amazon SageMaker (10 min)

Lead and facilitate a discussion around deploying models in Amazon SageMaker and why a RESTful ML API is useful.

Have students share their opinions with the class and bring up the following points:

**Pros:**

* Data storage capacity: By using an Amazon S3 bucket to store the data, we could have trained a model on multiple terabytes of data, or a lot more space than would otherwise have fit in our personal computer.

* Hardware / GPU: By using different Amazon SageMaker instances to train our model, we can access compute power including GPU capabilities, making powerful hardware available to us as required.

* Cost: Using AWS resources, we only pay for what we use, we'll turn off everything before ending the class and not incur in further charges.

* Availability: By deploying our model to another Amazon SageMaker instance, we have make the prediction functionality available 24/7 through a secured endpoint to an application or to be consumed by others without having to make our computer available.

* RESTful API: As learned in previous units, APIs provide a standard mechanism to access data, our ML API can be consumed through apps and other channels in a simple form while remaining secure and allowing other constraints (for example: authentication, authorization, rate limiting, etc.).

**Cons:**

* Data privacy / security: By uploading data to a third party, you are trusting your data on them. Certain kinds of data are subject to compliance and regulatory constraints.

* Visibility: You won't have oversight on AWS internal handling of your data and infrastructure.

* Availability: Although there are SLAs in place, AWS (and any other cloud providers) can and have suffered outages at times, causing data unavailability.
