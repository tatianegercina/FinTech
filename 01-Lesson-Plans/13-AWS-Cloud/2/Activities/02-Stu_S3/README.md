# Students Do: Creating Amazon S3 Buckets

In this activity, you will gain hands-on experience using Amazon S3 by creating two buckets.

## Instructions

1. Log-in into the AWS Management Console using your `administrator` IAM user.

2. In the "Find Services" search box, type `s3` and select the S3 service from the list.

3. From the Amazon S3 console, create a new private bucket in the `US East (Ohio)` region and name it as `sm-models-` followed by the current timestamp, for example: `sm-models-20200330-21-52`.

4. Upload a file to your brand new private bucket.

5. From the Amazon S3 console, create a new public bucket in the `Canada (Central)` region and name it as `public-share-` followed by the current timestamp, for example: `public-share-20200330-21-57`.

6. Upload an image to your brand new public bucket and set the permission to the file to be publicly available on the internet.

7. Open the object URL of the public image, and slack it to the partner next to you to corroborate that is genuinely public available.

## Hints

* Be sure to upload a creative commons licensed or free to use image or icon to the public bucket to avoid copyright infringement.
