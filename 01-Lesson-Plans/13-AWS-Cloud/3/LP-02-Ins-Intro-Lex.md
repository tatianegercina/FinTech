Start this activity by opening the [lesson slides](#), navigate to the _Intro to Lex_ section and highlight the following:

* Amazon Lex is an AWS service that allows developers to create conversational interfaces powered by the same deep learning technologies as Alexa.

* Getting started with Amazon Lex is quite easy, it's just a four steps process.

* All the complexity of deep learning algorithms is encapsulated, no coding is needed to start using it.

Introduce the Amazon Lex jargon to students using a day-to-day example like booking a hotel room; comment to students that they will gain hands-on experience with these concepts in Today's class.

Clarify to students the AWS regions where Amazon Lex is available, we will use `US West (Oregon)` for running the examples.
