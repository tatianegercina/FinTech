## 13.3 Lesson Plan - Amazon Lex and Robo Advisors

---

### Overview

In today's class students will create conversational interfaces using Amazon Lex, they also will be introduced to Amazon Lambda as a tool to enhance the interaction between a conversational bot and the user. Students will apply these new skills to create a robo advisor by the end of the class.

### Class Objectives

By the end of the unit, students will be able to:

* Describe the applications of conversational interfaces on FinTech.

* Recognize how machine learning contributes to create conversational interfaces.

* Create conversational interfaces using Amazon Lex.

* Apply their Python skills to add new features to an Amazon Lex bot.

* Deploy a robo advisor application on Slack.

### Instructor Notes

* There are several misconceptions and myths about what can be achieved with a Robo Advisor, make sure students understand what a Robo Advisor is and invite them to think about the endless possibilities of this technology on FinTech.

* Today's class would be challenging for students, they are going to deal with different AWS services and the Slack API, so be sure to get familiar with all the activities before class.

* Amazon Lambda functions will be created and edited using the online code editor, sometimes it get freezed, so recommend students to backup their code on a local Python script.

* Testing Amazon Lambda functions could be tricky and frustrating, so have your TAs assisting students while they are coding and testing them.

* Have your TAs keep track with the [Time Tracker](TimeTracker.xlsx)
