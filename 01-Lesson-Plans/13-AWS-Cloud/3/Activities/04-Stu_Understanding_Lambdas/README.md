# Understanding Lambdas

Getting started with AWS Lambda can be challenging. However, due to the capabilities that lambda provides, the effort is worth it. In this activity, you learn how Amazon Lex and AWS Lambda communicates with each other.

Using the code provided by the instructor, work with a partner to understand each line of the code. Explain it to each other and ask the TAs about anything that isn't clear. Once you finish reviewing the code, create your own lambda function using the code provided and configure your `Crypto_Converter` bot to use it as it was presented on the demo.

Once you finish configuring you bot, build a new version and test the conversation with some of the sample utterances. You final dialog should be similar to the following examples.

| _Bot demo conversation with valid user's data_ | _Bot demo conversation with invalid user's data_ |
| --- | ---|
