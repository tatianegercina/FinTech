# Understanding Lambdas

Getting started with AWS Lambda is definitely a challenge, however despite its capabilities, the effort is worth it. This is a group activity intended to allow you to go deeper on the code that has been presented on the last activity to have a better understanding about how Amazon Lex and AWS Lambda talks each other.

Work in groups up to three people, review the code shared by the Instructor line by line and comment with your mates about how the code is working, once you finish reviewing the code, create your own lambda function using the code provided and configure your `Crypto_Converter` bot to use it as it was presented on the demo.

Once you finish configuring you bot, build a new version and test the conversation with some of the sample utterances. You final dialog should be similar to the following examples.

| _Bot demo conversation with valid user's data_ | _Bot demo conversation with invalid user's data_ |
