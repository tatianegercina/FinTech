# Understanding Lambdas

Getting started with AWS Lambda can be challenging. However, due to the capabilities that lambda provides, the effort is worth it. In this activity, you will learn how Amazon Lex and AWS Lambda communicate with each other.

Using the code provided by the instructor, work with a partner to understand each line. Please explain it to each other and ask the TAs about anything that isn't clear. Once you finish reviewing the code, create your lambda function using the code provided, and configure your `Crypto_Converter` bot to use it as it was presented on the demo.

Once you finish configuring your bot, build a new version, and test the conversation with some of the sample utterances. Your final dialog should be similar to the following examples.

| _Bot demo conversation with valid user's data_ | _Bot demo conversation with invalid user's data_ |
