# AWS Billing Overview

The Free Tier of Amazon Web Services could be tricky since it may change its conditions, and you may not notice that. However, it is perhaps, a great offer to test AWS and gain hands-on experience.

Although we use the Free Tier in all the activities in this Unit, you may have some associated costs in your AWS account. That's why it is vital to check from time to time if there is any unplanned charge in the Billing & Cost Management Dashboard.

## Opening the Billing & Cost Management Dashboard

To open the Billing & Cost Management Dashboard, follow these steps:

* Log-in into the AWS Management console using your `administrator` IAM user or your root user.

* In the AWS Management Console, type `billing` in the "Find Services" box and select the "Billing" service.

* AWS bills you monthly for the total costs of the services you use out the limits of the Free Tier offer. In the billing homepage, you can see the costs spent in the current month, the balance from the last month, and a forecast to the current month.

* If you have any costs spent in the current month, you will see an expenses report per service to have a better understanding of which services are incurring at an additional cost.

## Set the Free Tier Usage Alerts

To avoid undesired charges to your credit card, you can turn on an AWS configuration option to receive an alert via e-mail when your AWS free tier service is about to exceed the usage limits.

To turn on this feature, choose "Billing preferences" in the left menu of the "Billing" section; next, enable the "Receive Free Tier Usage Alerts" option and type the e-mail address where you want to receive the usage alerts.

Click on the "Save preferences" button to finish.
