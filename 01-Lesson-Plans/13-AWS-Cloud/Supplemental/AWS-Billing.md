# AWS Billing Overview

Occasionally Amazon Web Services may change the conditions of the Free Tier usage. Despite this, the Free Tier is still a great opportunity to explore, test, and gain a hands-on experience in AWS. 

We use the Free Tier in all of the activities of this Unit but the goal is to avoid any unnecessary costs in your AWS account. That is why it is vital to check from time to time if there are any charges in the Billing & Cost Management Dashboard. Please follow the steps below to learn how to manage your expenses in AWS and turn on the Free Tier Usage alerts, which will warn you when you are nearing your usage limit.

## Opening the Billing & Cost Management Dashboard

To open the Billing & Cost Management Dashboard, follow these steps:

* Log-in into the AWS Management console using your `administrator` IAM user or your root user.

* In the AWS Management Console, type `billing` in the "Find Services" box and select the "Billing" service.

* AWS bills you monthly for the total costs of the services you use beyond the limits of the Free Tier. On the Billing homepage, you can see the costs spent in the current month, the balance from the last month, and a forecast for the current month.

* If you have any additional costs in the current month, you will see an expense report per service. This gives you insight into which services are incurring any additional cost.

## Set the Free Tier Usage Alerts

To avoid charges to your credit card, you can turn on an AWS configuration option to receive an alert via e-mail when your AWS Free Tier service is about to exceed the usage limits. To turn on these alerts, follow these steps:

* Log-in to the AWS Management console and navigate to the Billing dashboard.

* Choose "Billing Preferences" in the left menu of the "Billing" section. 

* Enable the "Receive Free Tier Usage Alerts" option and type the e-mail address where you want to receive the usage alerts.

* Click on the "Save preferences" button to finish.
