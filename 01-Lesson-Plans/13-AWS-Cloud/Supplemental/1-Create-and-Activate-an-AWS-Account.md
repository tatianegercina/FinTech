# Create and Activate an AWS Account

[Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-aws/) provides on-demand cloud computing platforms to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis. I you have never used this platform, the first step is to create your AWS account.

Once you create your brand new AWS account, you will have some services for free, please read the details abut the free tier on [this link](https://aws.amazon.com/free/). Your instructor will explain you the specific constraints of the free tier for the services we will use in class.

Follow this guide to get started with AWS by creating your personal account. Here's an overview of the process:

    **Important:** Be sure that you enter your account information correctly, especially your email address. If you enter your email address incorrectly, you won't be able to access your account. If **Create a new AWS account** isn't visible, first choose **Sign in to a different account**, and then choose **Create an AWS account**.

4. Choose **Personal** account type (unless you are a creating an account for a business).

    **Note:** Personal and professional accounts have the same features and functions. A personal account is recommended for this class.

5. Enter your company or personal information.

6. Read and accept the [AWS Customer Agreement][2].

    **Note:** Be sure that you read and understand the terms of the AWS Customer Agreement.

7. Choose **Create Account and Continue**.

You will receive an email to confirm that your account is created. You can sign in to your new account using the email address and password you supplied. However, you can't use AWS services until you finish activating your account.

## Add a payment method

On the **Payment Information** page, enter the information about your payment method, and then choose **Secure Submit**.

**Note:** If you want to use a different address for your AWS account, choose Use a new address before you choose **Secure Submit**.

## Verify your phone number

1. Choose whether you want to verify your account by **Text message (SMS)** or a **Voice call**.

2. Choose your country or region code from the list.

3. Enter a phone number where you can be reached in the next few minutes.

4. Enter the code displayed in the captcha.

5. When you're ready, choose **Contact me**. In a few moments, an automated system will contact you.

    **Note:** If you chose to verify your account by SMS, choose **Send SMS** instead.

6. Enter the PIN you receive by text message or voice call, and then choose **Continue**.

## Choose an AWS Support plan

On the **Select a Support Plan** page, choose one of the available Support plans. For this class we don't need any support, we'll go the the `Basic Support`.
For a description of the available Support plans and their benefits, see [Compare AWS Support Plans][3].

## Set the Free Tier Usage Alerts

To avoid undesired charges to your credit card, you can turn on an AWS configuration option to receive an alert via e-mail when your AWS free tier service is about to exceed the usage limits.

Follow the next steps to turn on this feature.

1. In the AWS Management Console home page type `billing` in the search box and choose the "Billing" option from the list.

## Wait for account activation

After you choose a Support plan, a confirmation page indicates that your account is being activated. Accounts are usually activated within a few minutes, but the process might take up to 24 hours.

You can sign in to your AWS account during this time. The AWS home page might display a button that shows "Complete Sign Up" during this time, even if you've completed all the steps in the sign-up process.

When your account is fully activated, you'll receive a confirmation email. After you receive this email, you have full access to all AWS services.

## Troubleshooting delays in account activation

Account activation can sometimes be delayed. If the process takes more than 24 hours, check the following:

* **Finish the account activation process.** You might have accidentally closed the window for the sign-up process before you've added all the necessary information. To finish the sign-up process, open  and sign in using the email address and password you chose for the account.
* **Check the information associated with your payment method.** Check [Payment Methods][4] in the AWS Billing and Cost Management console. Fix any errors in the information.
* **Contact your financial institution.** Financial institutions occasionally reject authorization requests from AWS for various reasons. Contact your payment method's issuing institution and ask that they approve authorization requests from AWS.
**Note:** AWS cancels the authorization request as soon as it's approved by your financial institution. You aren't charged for authorization requests from AWS. Authorization requests might still appear as a small charge (usually 1 USD) on statements from your financial institution.
* **Check your email for requests for additional information.** Check your email to see if AWS needs any information from you to complete the activation process.
* **Try a different browser.**
* **Contact AWS Support.** Contact [AWS Support][5] for help. Be sure to mention any troubleshooting steps that you already tried.
**Note:** Don't provide sensitive information, such as credit card numbers, in any correspondence with AWS.
