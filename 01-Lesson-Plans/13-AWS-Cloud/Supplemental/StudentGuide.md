<summary>What is the difference between supervised learning and unsupervised learning?</summary><br>
<blockquote>
<details>
<summary>Supervised Learning</summary>

Supervised machine learning uses labeled data with input variables (feature data) and output variables (target data) and uses the feature data to predict the target data.  The data is divided into training and testing sets.  The training set is used to teach (supervise!) the model so it learns how the input data is connected to the output data and can make predictions.  The testing data set is used to validate how well the model performs on data it has not seen before, by running the model on the testing feature data, and comparing it's predictions to the testing target data.<br>
<br>
An example of supervised learning would be to predict this year's final grades in a class based on last year's student study habit data as feature data, with their corresponding final grades as target data.  The model could be trained with the previous year's data, and then used to make predictions on this year's final grades using the study habit data from the new class.

<summary>Unsupervised Learning</summary>

Unsupervised learning models are given only input variables and must work to make connections to the data without predicting a labeled target.  These types of models are often clustering models that uncover connections in the data and group all the features into classes accordingly.<br>

An example of unsupervised learning would be to use website purchase data to group customers into two classes based on their spending habits.  This clustering might reveal that class 1 more spends more with a coupon incentive, while class 2 spends more on targeted advertising on social media.
