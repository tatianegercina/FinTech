# Creating an Amazon SageMaker Instance

In this guide, you will learn how you can start running Jupyter notebooks in the Cloud using Amazon SageMaker Studio.

Start by logging-in into the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) using your `administrator` IAM use and to follow the next steps.

From the AWS Management Console, type `sagemaker` in the "Find Services" search box and choose `Amazon SageMaker` from the list.

AWS currently offers Amazon SageMaker Studio as a generally available preview version from the US East (Ohio) AWS region. Since it's a preview version, some aspects of the user interface (UI) may vary over the time it's released as a final version.

In the Amazon SageMaker homepage, click on the "Amazon SageMaker Studio" at the left menu to continue.

If you are not in the `US East (Ohio)` AWS region, you will see a warning message asking for switching to that region. Open the AWS regions list, select the `US East (Ohio)` AWS region, and click again in the "Amazon SageMaker Studio" option in the left menu.

Continue by setting the initial configuration for Amazon SageMaker Studio, under the "Get Started" section, choose the "Quick Start" option and leave the default user name.

Next, in the "Execution role" option, click on the list box and choose "Create a new role"; a pop-up window named "Create an IAM role" will appear, select "Any S3 bucket" under the "S3 buckets you specify" option and click on the "Create role" button to continue.

Continue by clicking on the "Submit" button.

Next, the new instance of Amazon SageMaker Studio and the new user will be configured; you will be led to a new page where you may have to wait about five minutes.

Once the Amazon SageMaker Studio instance is ready, you will see the following notification message; you may have to wait an additional minute or two until the Studio user is ready, after that, you will see the "Open Studio" link enabled.

Continue by clicking on the "Open Studio" link, a new window (or tab) will be opened and you will see the following loading page until the UI of Amazon SageMaker Studio appears. **Note:** This process may take up to five minutes the first time.

After the loading process ends, you will see the UI of Amazon SageMaker Studio. You may note that it is practically the same UI as Jupyter lab but with a different colour scheme.

Amazon SageMaker Studio can be used in the same way you were working locally with Jupyter lab; the main difference is that Studio is a cloud application that allows access to all the computing power of AWS.

Continue by clicking in the "Launcher" tab. Amazon SageMaker has different built-in images to create notebooks; these images are similar to a Python virtual environment.

Continue by ensuring the "Data Science" image is selected; next, click on the "Python 3" notebook option. A fresh Jupyter notebook will appear, test it by printing a `Hello!!` message.

As any Jupyter lab interface, you can run notebooks and custom code in Amazon SageMaker Studio.
