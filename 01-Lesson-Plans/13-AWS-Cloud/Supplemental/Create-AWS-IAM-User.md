# Creating an Administrator User on AWS Identity and Access Management

Amazon Web Services provides a service called Identity and Access Management (IAM) to create and manage users. In this guide, you will learn how to create an `administrator` user using the AWS IAM service.

Having an `administrator` IAM user is a standard best practice is to avoid using the principal or root user to manage an AWS account and add some extra security when working on AWS.

This new user may look redundant with the root user, however, if the access credentials of this new `administrator` user get compromised, you can block it or recreate the password to secure your services without compromising your root user.

Usually a new user should be created for each person that requires administrative access to the services managed by an AWS root account, especially in corporate environments.

Follow the next steps to create an `administrator` IAM user:

* Open the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com) using your root user.

* Continue by looking for the IAM service on the Find Services search box, type `iam`, and click on IAM service.

* In the IAM start page, you may note that this service is marked as `Global` in the upper right corner, this means that IAM users can access AWS resources in any AWS Region. In the left pane menu, choose the "Users" option to continue.

  * **User name:** `administrator`
  * **Access type:** Select the "Programmatic access" and "AWS Management Console access" boxes.

Now, sign out from your current session with the root user to start using your new `administrator` user.

![Create an administrator IAM user - Step 14](Images/iam-user-14.png)

Open the `CSV` file with the new `administrator` user credentials you downloaded before and proceed as follows:

* In the `CSV` file, you will find a custom login link that you need to use to access the AWS Management Console with your `administrator` user.

  ![Create an administrator IAM user - Step 15](Images/iam-user-15.png)

* Copy the custom login link and paste it on your browser to open the custom login page. Type `administrator` as the "IAM user name" and the password you choose before. Click on the "Sign in" button to continue.

  ![Create an administrator IAM user - Step 16](Images/iam-user-16.png)

* Now you are logged-in into the AWS Management Console with your brand new IAM user. You may note that the IAM user name appears in the upper right corner, followed by your AWS account ID.

From now on, you should avoid using your "root user" and work with this new `administrator` user instead.
