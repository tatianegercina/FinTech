# Deleting AWS Resources

In this guide, you will learn how to delete your AWS resources so that no billing charges are incurred for it after class.

Log-in into the AWS Management Console using your `administrator` IAM user, open the Amazon SageMaker console and choose the "Endpoints" option in the left pane menu.

You should not have any endpoint in the "Endpoints" list, if any, select each endpoint and delete it from the "Actions" menu.

Every time you create a model, its configurations are stored, and we may want to delete them to avoid additional charges.

Click on "Endpoint configurations" in the left pane menu; you will see that there are several configurations.

Delete all the endpoint configurations by selecting each one and choosing the "Delete" option from the "Actions" menu.

* Select the bucket you want to delete, next, click on the "Delete" button.

You have to delete all the buckets manually. Since the AWS Free Tier offers twelve months of Amazon S3 storage, you can keep them if you want for one year.
