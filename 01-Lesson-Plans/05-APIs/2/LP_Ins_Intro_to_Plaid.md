* [Slides]()

Navigate to the 5.2 slides, and introduce the **Plaid** by highlighting how it is disrupting the FinTech data industry:

* According to a [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/donnafuscaldo/2019/02/06/plaid-and-quovo-just-scratching-the-surface-with-data-aggregation/#6e169e401841) (2009) article, FinTech is transforming into a new data industry that focuses on and specializes in the democratization of financial services. This is largely due the startup **Plaid**, a company seeking to enrich and empower consumers through financial data and technology.

* Whether intentional or not, **Plaid** is becoming the **Magellan** of this new FinTech market, circumnavigating the centralized FinTech powers that be and plotting the course for a new, democratized approach to financial services.

* As a FinTech company, **Plaid** has two customers in mind: the everyday person seeking to take ownership and control over their finances, and the developers seeking to design and build robust FinTech applications that enable financial analysis.

* **Plaid** is tipping the financial scales by breaking down barriers and providing a self-service platform not for FinTech professionals but for FinTech consumers: a platform offering data and analytic needs in order to promote the decentralization of financial analytics. **Plaid** literally bestows upon users the processing power and data access points previously reserved just for financial elites.

* What exactly does **Plaid** do? **Plaid** brokers connections to users' bank accounts to create a one-stop shop experience for financial management. Typically when analyzing data cross multiple accounts, one would have to visit each financial institution and extract the desired data. **Plaid** streamlines this process by offering a platform that will broker the request for data extraction so users do not have to manually do it. **Plaid** also offers analytics and insights products as well, helping users better understand trends in their data.

* **Plaid** offers the following services:

  * Help users monitor, budget, and gain insights from their personal finances

  * Help users manage data from multiple accounts (i.e. savings, equity, investments, retirement) in one platform

  * Up until now, students have been solely conducting quantitative analysis on investments.

Facilitate discussion with the following talking points and guided questions:

* **Plaid** can be used to analyze financial data in a more comprehensive and holistic view. **Plaid** takes the data from each financial account and consolidates it to create an overarching portfolio that encompasses savings, investments, retirement funds, loans, etc. What types of analysis can be done with these datasets?

  **Answer** Net worth analysis would require data to be extracted from all financial accounts.

* **Plaid** was created as a tool to assist developers in designing FinTech applications. By brokering connections to financial institutions, **Plaid** allows developers to focus on designing analytic pipelines for consumers that provide insight and drive financial budgeting decisions. If you had access to your savings, investment, and retirement account data, what would you do with it?

  **Answer** Calculate rate of cumulative returns daily, quarterly, and yearly to identify a baseline of cumulative returns over time. This insight could be used to change the types of funds, bonds, and individualized stocks used in each account.

  **Answer** Calculate **beta** to compare individualized stock and retirement portfolio volatility.

* By leveraging the data provided by **Plaid**, developers no longer have to concern themselves with data acquisition/brokering communication with financial institutions. Instead, developers can use the functions provided by the **Plaid** **SDK** to broker these connections. This means that developers are fully empowered to focus on designing innovative and valuable processes for consumers.
