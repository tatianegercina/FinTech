### 7. Students Do: Postman (15 mins)

It's time students stopped learning about APIs and started playing with some! In this activity, students will help Harold test out FinTech APIs using `Postman`. This will give students a better understanding of what `Postman` is and how it should be used, as well as expose students to one of the most common tools used in the FinTech industry.

Instruct TAs to make rounds to sure all students have `Postman` installed. Have TAs provide assistance/troubleshooting to any students experiencing issues getting started with `Postman`.

Slack out the supplemental `Postman Install Guide` to students so they have a step-by-step process for how to install and get started with `Postman`.
