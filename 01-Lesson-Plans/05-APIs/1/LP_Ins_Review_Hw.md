### 1. Instructor Do: Review Homework (5 mins)

**Files:**

* [README.md](../../../02-Homework/05-APIs/Instructions/README.md)

The APIs unit focuses on getting students thinking about different ways to leverage APIs to analyze financial data and create FinTech applications for everyday needs such as budget analysis and retirement planning.

Walk through the homework instructions, and highlight the following:

* The first component of the homework is focused on Budget Analysis. Students will use an API called `PLAID` to analyze personal financial data. `PLAID` can be used to securely access any type of banking, credit, or investment account, which opens doors to new services to customers that are not typically available without `PLAID`. The greatest thing about it is that you can confidently use `PLAID` knowing you can integrate it with other technologies and apps without security being compromised; `PLAID` handles the security and provisions access to personal financial accounts.

* With financial data available and accessible via `PLAID`, students will transition to using the financial data retrieved via `PLAID` to forecast financial goals. This section uses a monte carlo simulation to predict retirement portfolio performance to determine if a customer's initial retirement contribution will be sufficient to cover their future income.

* Lastly, students will analyze the output of the retirement planner activity and summarize assumptions and findings in a markdown file. This file will need to be uploaded to the Github repository.

Ask the students if there are any questions related to the homework.
