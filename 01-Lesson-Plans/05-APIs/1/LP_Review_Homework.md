### 1. Instructor Do: Review Homework (5 mins)

**Files:**

* [README.md](../../../02-Homework/05-APIs/Instructions/README.md)

The APIs unit focuses on getting students thinking about different ways to leverage APIs to analyze financial data and create FinTech applications for everyday needs such as budget analysis and retirement planning.

Walk through the homework instructions, and highlight the following:

* The first component of the homework is focused on Budget Analysis. Students will use an API called PLAID to analyze personal financial data. Instead of using personal accounts though, students will leverage the developer sandbox of data that PLAID offers.

* The second aspect of the homework includes creating a retirement planner. The goal with this activity is to get students using practical means to plan and evaluate retirement saving performance.

* Lastly, students will analyze the output of the retirement planner activity and summarize assumptions and findings in a markdown file. This file will need to be uploaded to the Github repository.

Ask the students if there are any questions related to the homework.
