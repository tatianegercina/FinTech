# Parlez-vouz le JSON?

Now that you know that the APIs below are working, go back and rerun one of them to get a closer look at the JSON data being returned. Capture your findings, and then turn and share your observations with a partner.

## APIs

* **Quandl:** <https://www.quandl.com/api/v3/datasets/WIKI/GOOG.json?api_key=YOUR_KEY_GOES_HERE>

* **World Bank:** <http://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/ca/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?format=json>

* **Coinbase:** <https://api.coinbase.com/v2/prices/BTC-CAD/buy?format=json>

## Instructions

1. Quickly get into two-person teams.

2. Each member should choose one of the APIs above to execute in `Postman`.

3. Execute the API request and view the output in `JSON` format.

4. Read through the JSON. Try and make sense of a sub-section of the data (i.e., close date for a specific ticker, the Canadian 2018 GDP value, or current price of Ethereum).

5. Turn and teach your partner about what you deciphered from the JSON data.
