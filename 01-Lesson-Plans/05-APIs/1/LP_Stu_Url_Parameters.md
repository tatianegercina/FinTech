### 16. Students Do: URL Parameters (15 mins)

Students play a game of BlackJack using the `Deck of Cards` API. The key skills reinforced in this activity include the execution of `GET` requests using the Python `requests library`, extraction of JSON elements, and parameterization of API `request urls`.

Students can play the game against an imaginary dealer or a classmate. Students are encouraged to work as partners so they can pair-program and play against one another.
