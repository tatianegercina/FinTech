## 5.1 Lesson Plan - APIs

### Overview

For the past three weeks, students have been deep-dived into the world of Python and common Python libraries that come included in the Anaconda environment (i.e. Pandas and Matplotlib). They've also learned some key techniques for analyzing financial data, such as calculating daily returns and risk-reward ratios. It's now time for students to take it to the next level and enter into the world of APIs. There are a number of FinTech APIs available that will allow students to perform more powerful analytics. They will also expose students to datasets they would not typically be able to easily access or consolidate. Now students will learn the basics of APIs and API requests so that they can begin incorporating APIs into their work.

Today's class will teach students what APIs are, what they're used for, and why they are valuable. Students will also learn, from a high level, what the client-server model is and how it works. Students will submit API calls with Postman and Python, as well as how decipher and parse API JSON output. Lastly, students will submit API calls with parameters in order to improve response time and filter/narrow down API output. Learning how to make API calls and parse API output using Postman and Python will prepare students for getting their hands dirty with APIs in the professional world.

### Class Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Describe the client server model

* Read documentation and identify endpoints from a given API

* Perform a GET request and view the JSON response using the Postman client

* Interpret the JSON structure from a GET request response

* Use the requests library to request JSON data from an API within Python

* Parse a JSON response and print a selected field using Python

* Query an API using URL Parameters with the requests library

### Instructor Notes

* This class will focus on the fundamentals of APIs and the process of submitting APIs. This class is a great opportunity for students to be impressed and inspired by FinTech. There are a number of fun and creative FinTech APIs, such as Quandl and World of Bank, that will be used to drive student engagement. This lesson is the perfect opportunity to get students excited about FinTech again!

* The first half of the lesson will include instructor demonstrations of submitting requests to different FinTech APIs using Postman. Each demo should be focused on showcasing FinTech APIs and getting students excited about contributing to the wealth of APIs that are already out there. Make sure to create accounts for these APIs:

  * Postman

  * World of Bank

  * Quandl

* The welcome class module will be dedicated to demoing some of the previously mentioned FinTech APIs.

* Working with APIs can be challenging for anyone using them, especially when documentation is limited. Whenever introducing students to a new API, slack out the link to the documentation so that students have access to it for reference.

Be sure to set the pace for the class. Encourage students to attend office hours if they feel lost or stuck. Also encourage students to work with partners.

* Have your TAs keep track with the [Time Tracker](TimeTracker.xlsx)
