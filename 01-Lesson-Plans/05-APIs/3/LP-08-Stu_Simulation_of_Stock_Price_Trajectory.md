Open the solution and explain the following:

* Make sure that the `IEX_TOKEN` environment variable is properly set so that the `iexfinance` SDK can communicate to the `IEX Cloud` API. Navigate [here](https://addisonlynch.github.io/iexfinance/stable/configuration.html) for more details on how to do so.
