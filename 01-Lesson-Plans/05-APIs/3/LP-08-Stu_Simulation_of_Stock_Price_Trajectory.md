### 9. Students Do: Stock Price Forecasting (15 mins)

In this activity, students execute a Monte Carlo simulation to analyze the probability distribution of potential hits (out of `5` shots) of a target for a beginner archer with a `20%` accuracy and determine the range of hits for the archer that has a `95%` chance of happening in a single session.

Open the solution and explain the following:

* Make sure that the `IEX_TOKEN` environment variable is properly set so that the `iexfinance` SDK can communicate to the `IEX Cloud` API. Navigate [here](https://addisonlynch.github.io/iexfinance/stable/configuration.html) for more details on how to do so.
