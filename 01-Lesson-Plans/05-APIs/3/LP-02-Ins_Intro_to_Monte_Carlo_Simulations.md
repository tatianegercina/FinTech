### 2. Instructor Do: Intro to Monte Carlo Simulations (5 mins)

Present the following questions and answers regarding simulations:

* What is a simulation?

  > At its core, a simulation is a running instance of a model that seeks to emulate an existing process or system. 

* What is a Monte Carlo Simluation?

  > Like a simulation, a Monte Carlo Simulation goes the next step and is a simulation that uses probability and variables to predict the future outcomes of a random process.

* What is probability?

  > The chance of an event happening. For example, the chance of a coin landing on heads is 50%.
