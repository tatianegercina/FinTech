### 2. Instructor Do: Intro to Monte Carlo Simulations (10 mins)

Ease students into the notion of Monte Carlo simluations by presenting the following questions and answers:

* What is a simulation?

  > At its core, a simulation is a running instance of a model that seeks to emulate an existing process or system. 

* What is a Monte Carlo Simluation?

  > Like a simulation, a Monte Carlo Simulation goes the next step and is a simulation that uses probability and variables to predict the future outcomes of a random process; Monte Carlo simulations are used to understand the risk of uncertainty in prediction and forecasting models.

* What is probability?

  > The chance of an event happening. For example, the chance of a coin landing on heads is 50%.

* What would be an example of a Monte Carlo Simulation?

  > Imagine 5 trials of flipping a coin 10 times. There is a 50% chance of landing on heads and a 50% chance of landing on tails. Flipping a coin 10 times for 5 trials may have varying results: 6 heads and 4 tails; 3 heads and 7 tails; 8 heads and 2 tails, etc. Therefore, a Monte Carlo simulation would flip a coin 10 times to determine the resulting combination of heads and tails, and then do that same process of flipping a coin 10 times another `n` number of times to determine the most probable combination of heads and tails if a coin were to be flipped 10 times.

Answer any student questions before moving on.
