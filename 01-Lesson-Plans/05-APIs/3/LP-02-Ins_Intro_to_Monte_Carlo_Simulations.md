### 2. Instructor Do: Intro to Monte Carlo Simulations (10 mins)

Ease students into the notion of Monte Carlo simluations by presenting the following questions and answers:

* What is a simulation?

  > At its core, a simulation is a running instance of a model that seeks to emulate an existing process or system. 

* What is a Monte Carlo simluation?

  > A Monte Carlo simulation is a specific type of simulation that uses probability and variables to predict the future potential outcomes of a randomly occurring process; Monte Carlo simulations are used to understand the risk of uncertainty in prediction and forecasting models.

* What is probability?

  > The chance of an event happening. For example, the chance of a coin landing on heads is 50%.

* What would be an example of a Monte Carlo simulation?

  > Imagine a scientist wanted to know how often coin a could land on heads for 5 trials of 10 coin flips. Flipping a coin has a 50% chance of landing on heads and a 50% chance of landing on tails. Because of the randomly occurring nature of flipping a coin, results could vary: for example, a coin could produce 6 heads and 4 tails; 3 heads and 7 tails; 8 heads and 2 tails, 5 heads and 5 tails, or 4 heads and 6 tails. Therefore, an example Monte Carlo simulation would be to flip a coin 10 times to determine the resulting number of heads and tails, and then do that same process another 5 times to determine the frequency distribution of landing on heads (how many times the coin landed a specific number of heads). The frequency distribution of heads can then be used to calculate the corresponding probability distribution that determines how often a specific number of heads could land.

Ask the students if they can think of any other examples of Monto Carlo simulations. Be sure to have all the students on the same page before moving on.
