### 12. Instructor Do: Intro to Portfolio Forecasting (10 mins)

At this point, students have executed Monte Carlo simulations, learned to interpret frequency distributions, probability distributions, confidence intervals, and realized how to apply Monte Carlo simulations to forecast the future prices (and corresponding returns) of individual stocks. Now, students will take their journey one step further and learn how to apply Monte Carlo simulations to forecast the returns of a portfolio, which can be comprised of either all stocks or a combination of multiple asset classes such as stocks and bonds.

Present the following questions and answers regarding portfolio forecasting:

* What is portfolio forecasting?

  > Portfolio forecasting is the process of projecting the future performance of a portfolio and attempting to analyze its most probable outcome, or in this case, cumulative return as well as the portfolio's range of potential cumulative returns and their corresponding probabilities of occurring.

* How is portfolio forecasting done?

  > Similar to the forecasting of a stock's price trajectory, monte carlo simulations are applied to forecast the potential price trajectories of the individual stocks that comprise the portfolio. Then the series of returns (ex. daily, weekly, monthly) of each stock is calculated and multiplied by the corresponding weights within the portfolio to output the portfolio's series of returns. Finally, the series of returns for the portfolio are used to generate the cumulative returns, which can then be multiplied by an investment amount to determine the portfolio performance in terms of capital.

* Why is portfolio forecasting performed?

  > Similar to forecasting an individual stock's price trajectory to get a sense of the possibilities and corresponding probabilities of where it's price could move, forecasting a portfolio is of the same reasoning. Doing so helps to analyze the potential risk and likelihood that a portfolio's performance can deviate from the expected result.

* Who is performing portfolio forecasting?

  > Portfolio managers, quantitative analysts, retirement planners, are just one of many who need to forecast the future performance of a portfolio to gauge the potential risk of investment.

Ask the students if they have any questions or concerns before moving on.
