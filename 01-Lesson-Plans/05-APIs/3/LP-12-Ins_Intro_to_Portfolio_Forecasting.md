### 12. Instructor Do: Intro to Portfolio Forecasting (10 mins)

At this point, students have executed Monte Carlo simulations, learned to interpret frequency distributions, probability distributions, confidence intervals, and realized how to apply Monte Carlo simulations to forecast the future prices (and corresponding returns) of individual stocks. Now, students will take their journey one step further and learn how to apply Monte Carlo simulations to forecast the returns of a portfolio, which can be comprised of either all stocks or combination of multi asset classes such as stocks and bonds.

Presenting the following questions and answers regarding portfolio forecasting:

* What is portfolio forecasting?

Ask the students if they can think of any other examples of Monto Carlo simulations. Be sure to have all the students on the same page before moving on.
