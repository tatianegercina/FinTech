# Archery Target Hits

In this activity, an archery master wants to assess the long-term performance of one of his beginner archers when it comes to hitting the target. The beginner archer has a shot accuracy of approximately `20%` and therefore on average hits the target `1` time for every `5` shots. The archery master wants to know what the range of target hits (out of `5` shots) the beginner archer is likely to make for a `95%` confidence interval. In other words, what is the range of targets that the beginner archer will hit out of `5` shots if we are `95%` certain of the outcome?

Create a Monte Carlo simulation with `1000` simulations of `5` shots to analyze the beginner archer's frequency distribution and corresponding probability distribution of hit targets to determine the `95%` confidence interval of hit targets.

## Instructions

* Using the starter file provided, walk through the following steps.

  * Import libraries and dependencies

  * Write a Monte Carlo simulation that loops through `5` shots for every simulation of `1000` simulations and saves the results:

    * Set variables for the desired number of simulations and shots.

    * Create a list `shot` consisting of the strings `hit` and `missed`.

    * Create an empty `pandas` DataFrame to hold the results of each simulation.

    * Create a nested for loop to loop through `5` shots for every simulation of `1000` simulations.

    * Use the `choice` function from the `random` class of the `numpy` library to randomly choose between the list elements `hit` and `missed` of the `shot` list. Use the `p` parameter for the `choice` function to specify the probabilities of hitting a shot and missing a shot; set the `p` parameter to `[0.2, 0.8]`.

    * Append the results to the DataFrame, with each column set as the series of free throw results for every simulation.

  * Loop through every column of the DataFrame and use the `value_counts` function to count the number of hit shots per simulation. Select only the values of the `hit` key from the Series object that the `value_counts` function returns. Save the results to another DataFrame.

  * Create a frequency distribution histogram from the DataFrame of hit target shots per simulation. Make sure to manually set the bin edges using the `bin` parameter.

  * Create a probability distribution histogram from the DataFrame of hit target shots per simulation. Set the `density` parameter to `True`.

  * Use the `quantile` function and create a `95%` confidence interval range from the DataFrame of hit target shots per simulation.

  * Plot the upper and lower bounds of the `95%` confidence interval over the probability distribution histogram of hit targets shots.
