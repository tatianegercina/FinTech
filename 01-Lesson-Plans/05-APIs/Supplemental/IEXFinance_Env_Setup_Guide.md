# IEXFinance Environment Setup Guide

This guide serves as a step by step process for setting up and validating the `iexfinance` Python SDK. Without this library, class activities and code will not be able to extract historical stock data and therefore will not be able to be completed.

This guide will include installation and verification steps for the following technologies:

* IEXFinance

## IEXFinance

### Install

In order to install the `iexfinance` package, all of the dependencies must be satisfied. The dependencies list can be found below for reference.

* Pandas

* Requests

Open a terminal, and execute the following command to install `iexfinance`.

* Use the `pip install` command to download the `iexfinance` module.

  ```shell
  pip install iexfinance
  ```

### Verify Installation

Once the `iexfinance` download is complete, verify the installation completed successfully.

* Use the `pip list` function with a `grep` argument to identify if the `iexfinance` library installed successfully.

  ```shell
  pip list | grep iexfinance
  ```

### Set `IEX_TOKEN` environment variable

In order to use the iexfinance SDK, you will need to set your `IEX_TOKEN` environment variable prior to using the library, as iexfinance communicates with the IEX Cloud API.

Go to [IEX Cloud](https://iexcloud.io/) and login to your account. Then grab your API token as shown below.

Then, open up a terminal and use the following command `export IEX_TOKEN=<public key>` to set your `IEX_TOKEN` environment variable. Use the `echo` command to verify that the `IEX_TOKEN` variable has been properly set.

### Troubleshooting

It can be frustrating when packages do not install correctly, therefore use the below approaches to troubleshoot any installation or usage issues.

**Update Conda Environment**

An out-of-date Anaconda environment can create issues when trying to install new packages. Follow the below steps to update your conda environment.

1. Deactivate your current conda environment. This is required in order to update the global conda environment. Be sure to quit any running applications, such as Jupyter, prior to deactivating the environment.

    ```shell
    conda deactivate
    ```

2. Update conda.

    ```shell
    conda update conda
    ```

3. Create a fresh conda environment to use with iexfinance.

    ```shell
    conda create -n iexenv python=3.7 anaconda
    ```

4. Activate the new environment.

    ```shell
    conda activate iexenv
    ```

5. Install the **iexfinance** package.

    ```shell
    pip install iexfinance
    ```

**Verify IEX Cloud Usage**

Sometimes, queries to the IEX Cloud API will fail. This is most likely because of a max usage related to a IEX Cloud account, as shown below.

  ![iex-cloud-account-usage](Images/iex-cloud-account-usage.png)

Therefore, there are two options:

  1. Create another free IEX Cloud account.

  2. Upgrade your IEX Cloud account to a paid tier.

Consult the [iexfinance](https://addisonlynch.github.io/iexfinance/stable/index.html) documentation for additional information about the **iexfinance** library.
