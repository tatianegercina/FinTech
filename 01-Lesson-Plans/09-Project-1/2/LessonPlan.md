## 9.2 Lesson Plan—Project Work

In today's class, students will outline their presentations and complete work on their projects.

### Class Objectives

* Students should spend the entire class working on their projects.

* Students should spend at least 30 minutes strategizing with their groups on how to present their project.

### Instructor Notes

This is the last day of class that students have to work on their projects! Therefore, it is of utmost importance that they spend time thinking about how they'll present their project on Saturday.

Your students' success after the boot camp depends on the quality of their projects, and their presentations are a major component of this. Students need to think critically about how to communicate the development process of their apps if they want to impress hiring managers with their experience.

The remaining schedule for Project 1 is as follows:

* Day 5 (today):

  * Students continue planning their final presentations.

  * Students have the remainder of class to work on projects.

* Day 6:

  * Students present their final projects!

### 1. Welcome Class (5 min)

Welcome the class and check whether students have any questions about past concepts.

### 2. Student Do: Outline Presentation (30 min)

Tell students that they have the next 30 minutes to outline their presentations. Make sure students don't code. 

Instead, they should consider:

* Their presentation structure

* The key messages to communicate

* Any details they should _avoid_ reviewing (each presentation is limited to 10 minutes). 

(Note: Presentation length can be adjusted based on class size.)

Offer the following tips:

* The presentation of any project should flow like a story. The narrative should begin by presenting the problem, hint at the potential solution, detail the steps needed to resolve the issue, and end with the resolution of the problem. In other words:
  
  1. What problem does the app attempt to solve?
  
  2. How does the app solve this problem at a high-level?
  
  3. What steps were taken to build the app?
  
  4. Show the app running and solving the problem, as outlined in your narrative. Discuss any features you'd like to add in an update to your app.

While the groups organize their presentations, answer any questions they might have about Saturday.

About 10 minutes in, walk around and make sure that students aren't coding. If iany of them are, just walk up and warmly inquire how they're progressing so far with their outline.

Don't accuse them of not following directions; just steer them back on course.

### 3. Student Do: Project Work (60 min)

Tell students they may work on coding their app again, or spend more time on their presentations—whichever they'd prefer.

TAs and instructors: For the next 45 minutes, you'll be senior developers again. Check in with each group and answer any questions they may have about coding their apps or presenting on Saturday.

Some students may feel nervous with the deadline approaching. Reassure them that they have solid project ideas and that they'll be fine on Saturday, as long as they take time to prepare.

A few groups might not seem like they will finish their apps on time. Tell them to drop any undeveloped and unnecessary features. Even if they can't meet their proposed goal, they should still present a functional app on Saturday. Suggest that they talk about any dropped features as planned updates.
