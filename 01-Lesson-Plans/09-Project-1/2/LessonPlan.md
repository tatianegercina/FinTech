## 9.2 Lesson Plan—Project Work

In today's class, students will have time to outline their presentations and complete work on their projects.

##### Instructor Priorities

* Students should have the entirety of today's class to work on their projects.

* Make sure your students spend at least 30 minutes collaborating with teammates on how they'll present their project.

##### Instructor Notes

This is the last day of class that students have to work on their projects. That's why they need to spend time thinking about how they'll present their project on Saturday.

Once again, your students' success after the boot camp depends on the quality of their projects. Their presentations compose much of this quality—students need to think about how to communicate the development process of their apps if they hope to impress interviewers with their experience.

The remaining schedule for Project 1 is as follows:

* Day 5 (today):

  * Students begin planning their final presentations.

  * Students are given rest of class to work on projects.

* Day 6:

  * Students present their final projects!

### Class Objectives

* To provide students more time and support for their group projects.

* **To make sure students spend at least a half hour outlining their presentations**.

- - -

### 1. Welcome Class (5 min)

Welcome the class and check whether students have any questions about past concepts.

### 2. Student Do: Outline Presentation (30 min)

Announce that students have the next half-hour to outline their presentations.

Make sure they don't code. They should consider:

  * The structure of their presentation

  * The key messages they need to show

  * The details that they should _avoid_ reviewing (they only have 10 minutes to talk). (Note: Adjust the presentation time based on your class size.)

Offer these tidbits of advice:

* The presentation of any project to an audience must flow like a story. Your narrative should open on a conflict, hint at a potential resolution for that problem, depict the steps taken to resolve the issue, and finally end on the resolution of the conflict with an eye toward the future. In other words:
  1. What problem does your app focus on?
  2. How does your app solve this problem at a high-level?
  3. What steps did you take to build the app?
  4. Show the app running and solving the problem that began your story. Also talk about what features you'd like to add in an update to your app.

While the groups organize their presentations, offer to answer any questions about Saturday.

About 10 minutes in, you should walk around and make sure that students aren't coding. If it looks like they are, just walk up and warmly ask how they're progressing so far with their outline.

Don't accuse them of not following directions; just steer them on course.

### 3. Student Do: Project Work (60 min)

Tell your students that they may work on coding their app again or spend more time on their presentations—whichever they'd prefer.

TAs and instructors: For the next 45 minutes, you'll once again be senior developers. Visit each group and answer any questions they may have about coding their apps or presenting on Saturday.

Some students may feel nervous with their deadline approaching. Reassure them that they have solid project ideas and that they'll be fine on Saturday as long as they prepare for their presentation.

A few groups might not seem poised to finish their apps on time. Tell them to drop any undeveloped and unnecessary features. Even if they can't meet their proposed goal, they should still present a functional app on Saturday. Add that they can talk about the dropped features as planned updates.
