## 9.1 Lesson Plan—Project Work

### Overview

Most of this class will center on project work. You and the TAs should check on each group and make sure they're moving smoothly toward Saturday's presentations.

### Class Objectives

* Students have the entire class to work on their group projects.

* Students should make measurable progress with their project work.

---

##### Instructor Notes

Your students should be nearing the end of their projects. Even though it's the beginning of the week, you should push students to finish their apps before Thursday, so they have enough time to practice their presentations.

It's crucial that you help steer any projects back that have fallen off course to get back on track. By the next class, the encroaching Saturday deadline will impede any attempts at a turnaround.

The remaining schedule for Project 1 is as follows:

* Day 4 (today) and Day 5:

  * Students have the entire class for project work.

* Day 6:

  * Students present their projects!

### 1. Welcome Class (5 min)

Welcome students to class, and ask if they have any questions about past concepts.

### 2. Instructor Do: Ask About Projects (5 min)

Begin by sharing your excitement on how eager you are to see the projects students are presenting on Saturday. After only spending eight weeks in the course, they've come up with some impressive concepts and should feel proud about all the hard work they've put in. They've come a long way since starting out with just Excel!

Ask students to share any feedback they have on the collaboration experience so far, as well as any anxiety they might be feeling as presentation day draws closer.

* Provide reassuring answers to any concerns or anxieties that arise. If you've had similar doubts in your education and/or career, share an experience or two on how you overcame them.

* If no one responds, it's likely because they're wary of sharing any apprehension in front of their peers. Assure them that if they're anxious about their project work, other students feel the same way. Encourage them to share these thoughts—talking is an essential step to overcoming them.

### 3. Student Do: Project Work (1 hour, 20 minutes)

Ask students to assemble into their groups, and try as best they can to finish 95% of their code and design by the end of the next class. This will give them most of Thursday and Friday to spend on presentations.

Tell students they should come into the next class expecting to devote at least 30 minutes to outlining their presentations. They'll also have time to work on the rest of their project.

TAs and instructors: For the next 90 minutes, you're senior developers! Walk around the class as mentors for each group's team. Ask them about their progress so far, and offer advice on how they can finish their work in time.

* If any team members have completed the work that their roles entailed, or are waiting for others to complete tasks before they can continue, ask these students to talk with their teammates to see how else they can assist.

* Some students might be stumped by technology that hasn't been covered in class that they are trying to use in their project. See if you can help out. If you're not familiar with the tech, direct the student to someone in the Boot Camp team who is.

* Make sure that all teams are on track to complete their projects by Saturday.

### 4. BREAK (15 min)

### 5. Student Do: Project Work (1 hour, 15 minutes)

Allow students to continue working on their projects.
