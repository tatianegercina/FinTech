## 9.3 Lesson Plan—Project 1 Presentations

Today, students will present their project apps to the class! Afterwards, they will answer questions from you, TAs, and classmates. This is a **crucial** lecture for your students, so make sure you follow the advice in this plan.

### Class Objectives

* Arrive early to class to prepare the room for presentations—Panopto, microphone, and any other equipment.

* Provide students more time and support for their group projects.

---

##### Instructor Notes

* Students should expect a longer class today, as presentations tend to extend past the allotted time.

* Provide constructive feedback so students are aware of what went well, and what they can improve upon. This will help guide them regarding what aspects of development to focus on for future projects.

### 1. Instructor Do: Set Up Your Equipment (15 minutes before class)

Come to class with enough time to set up your laptop and other equipment. It is advisable to prepare a list of the GitHub pages links for all deployed repos, so students can quickly launch their apps.

If students have hosted presentations on Google Presentations, compile a list of those as well, to avoid switching computers.

### 2. Instructor Do: Welcome Class (5 min)

Welcome students and check whether anyone has any questions before the presentations begin.

### 3. Instructor Do: Introduce Presentations (5 min)

Congratulate students for developing their projects to a state worth presenting to the class. They should take pride in what they've done over just nine weeks of training!

Tell students to deploy their latest changes to GitHub. After this, all it will take is a quick pull to get any changes.

Make sure groups have deployed their app to GitHub Pages as well. We want to see their projects in action!

Share the following breakdown and tips on presenting with the class:

1. Each presentation should last eight minutes, followed by two to four minutes of open-floor Q&A. (Note: Adjust the presentation time based on your class size.)

2. Advise speakers to talk directly **into** the microphone—this ensures that high-quality audio is captured for the recorded presentation.

3. Show confidence! Each student has contributed to an impressive project—they should project this knowledge and poise during their demonstrations.

Ask which groups would like to present first, second, and so on. When groups stop responding, assign the remaining teams to  the remaining slots (write this list down).

### 4. Presentations Part 1 (1 hour, 30 minutes)

* Go down the list and send each group up to the front of class. Give students roughly three minutes of setup time.

* When a group nears the nine-minute mark, motion for them to draw their presentation to a close by pointing to your wrist. Don't speak, as you don't want to interrupt their talk, especially since they are being recorded.

* Each presentation should be followed by a Q&A session, with TAs and classmates posing questions, too.

* When the Q&A session ends, stop recording. When Panopto stops, provide feedback on what you found impressive and what can be improved upon for future demonstrations.

* When a group finishes after noon, announce a break.

### 5. BREAK (40 min)

---

### 6. Presentations Part 2 (1 hour, 30 minutes)

Just as in Step 4, send each group up to the front of class when their turn comes.

### 7. Congratulate Students (10 min)

When the last group finishes, give the class an estimate for when they can expect to have their recorded presentations. Tell students that they should put their demonstrations on LinkedIn, along with links to their GitHub repositories.

Congratulate them! It's challenging to conceive, develop, and present a new FinTech project. Remind them that they accomplished all this in just nine weeks, and tell them to imagine what they'll come up with in their next two projects, after learning even more techniques.
