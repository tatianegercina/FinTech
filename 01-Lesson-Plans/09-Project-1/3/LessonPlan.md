## 9.3 Lesson Plan—Project 1 Presentations

In this class, your students will present their project apps to the class! They’ll afterward answer open-floor questions from you, TAs, and classmates. This is a **crucial** lecture for your students, so make sure you follow the advice in this plan.

##### Instructor Priorities

* Students should expect an extended class today—these presentations tend to last longer than our allotted time.

* Students should know the parts of their projects that impress you and the TAs and what they can improve on for future projects. This will help direct their focus for future assignments on what aspects of development they need to work on.

---

### Class Objectives

* Arrive early to class so that you can set the room up for presentations—Panopto, microphone, and the rest of your equipment.

* To provide students more time and support for their group projects.

### 0. Instructor Do: Set Up Your Equipment (15 minutes before class)

Make sure to come to class and setup your laptop and other equipment. It is recommended that you prepare a list of the GitHub pages links for all deployed repos so that students can quickly launch their apps.

If students have hosted presentations on Google Presentations, compile a list of those as well to avoid switching computers.

### 1. Instructor Do: Welcome Class (5 min)

Welcome students and check whether anyone has any questions before the presentations begin.

### 2. Instructor Do: Introduce Presentations (5 min)

Congratulate your class for developing their projects to a state worth presenting. Assure them that they should take pride in what they've done over a mere nine weeks of training!

Tell students to deploy their latest changes to GitHub. After this, all it will take is a quick pull to get any changes.

Make sure groups have deployed their app to GitHub Pages, as well. We want to see their projects in action!

Give students a rundown of how their presentations should pan out.

1. They should last about eight minutes, followed by two to four minutes of open-floor Q&A. (Note: Adjust the presentation time based on your class size.)

2. They should speak **into** the microphone—this ensures that we capture high-quality audio for their recorded presentation.

3. They need to show confidence! All of them have contributed to impressive projects—they need to recognize and project that during their demonstrations.

Ask which groups would like to go first, then second and so on. When groups stop responding, assign the remaining teams to random slots (and write this list down).

### 3. Presentations Part 1 (1 hour, 30 minutes)

* Go down the list and send each group up to the front of class. Give students roughly three minutes of setup time.

* When a group nears the nine-minute mark, motion for them to draw their presentation to a close (try pointing to your wrist). Don't say anything—you don't want your voice to interrupt their talk, especially since you're recording them.

* Follow each of these presentations up with questions about their projects. Let TAs and classmates ask questions, too.

* When the Q&A session ends, stop recording. When Panopto stops, point out what you found impressive and what they can improve on for future demonstrations.

* When a group finishes after noon, announce a break.

### 4. BREAK (40 min)

---

### 5. Presentations Part 2 (1 hour, 30 minutes)

Just as in step 3, send each group up to the front of class when their turn comes.

### 6. Congratulate Students (10 min)

When the last group finishes, give them an estimate for when they can expect to have their recorded presentations. Tell each of them that they should put their demonstrations up on LinkedIn along with links to their GitHub repositories.

Congratulate them! It's challenging to conceive, develop, and present a new FinTech project. Remind them that this they accomplished all this in just nine weeks, and tell them to imagine what they'll come up with in their next two projects after learning even more techniques.
