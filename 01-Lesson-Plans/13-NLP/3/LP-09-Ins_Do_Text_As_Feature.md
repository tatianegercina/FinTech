### 9. Instructor Do: Text as Feature (15 mins)

In this activity we'll ask students to remind themselves of the tools and techniques they've learned in this unit and talk about how we can use them to create numerical features (structured data) from text (unstructured data). 

Ask the class to recall the lessons of this unit. Call on volunteers to list some of the tools and techniques that we've learned in this unit.

* Techniques include preprocessing, tokenizing, and lemmatizing text; aggregating word counts; creating n-grams; normalizing to tf-idf weights; sentiment analysis; parsing and pos-tagging text; and named entity recognition. Tools include the libraries NLTK, wordcloud, and spacy.

We've learned a lot! Tell the class that it's often not enough to transform text data in the ways that we've done. In order to use this data for classification or prediction, we need to make them features - numerical representations of unstructured text. Ask the class for examples of features that can be created from text documents.

* Some examples of features include: length of document; count of a key word; count of named entities; sentiment scores; percent of words that are adjectives; and total tf-idf score. These features can then be used to, for example, classify a document to a category or predict the effect of a earnings call on stock price. 

Let the class know that the remainder of the class will be spent on practicing ways to engineer features from text and then correlating those features to variables of interest in the real world: stock prices, earning results, or investment decisions, for example.
