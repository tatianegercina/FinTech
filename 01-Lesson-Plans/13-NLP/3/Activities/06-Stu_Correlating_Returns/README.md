# Correlating Returns

In this activity you will create a sentiment index from newsapi headlines and correlated it to S&P 500 daily returns, looking for text topic that generates the highest correlation.

## Instructions

* Download returns data for the past month for the S&P 500 Index.  
* Get news headlines for at least 5 topics of your choice and apply sentiment analysis to the headlines. 
* Correlate the headlines' sentiment to S&P 500 returns for each topic. Which one had the highest correlation?

## Hint

* In order to correlate sentiment and returns, we need to make sure that they're grouped in the same unit - in this case, trading days.
