# Crude Stopwords

In this activity you will practice creating a function that strips non-letter characters from a document and then applies stopwording.

## Instructions

* Complete a function called clean_text that takes in a document and returns a list of words that does not include stopwords or any non-letter characters. 
* Inspect the results of this function and keep track of the words that exist in the result and are uninformative. 
* Re-implement clean_test, this time with a set of custom stopwords to apply
