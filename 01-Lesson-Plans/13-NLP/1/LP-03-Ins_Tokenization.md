### 3. Instructor Demo: Tokenization (0:10 mins)

This activity introduces students to tokenization, the process with which we break down documents into smaller units of analysis. Tokenizing is crucial because many of the NLP techniques we'll learn about, including frequency analysis and sentiment analysis, use word, phrase, or sentence level "chunks" instead of the entire document all at once.
