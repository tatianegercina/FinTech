# The Feelings of the Crisis

While reading news articles normally the title is the hook, perhaps a negative title could lead you to skip reading an article if you don't want to be in a bad mood. But is this fair enough?

On this activity you are tasked to corroborate if a news title with a negative sentiment leads or not to a negative content. You will use VADER sentiment to accomplish this work using the news articles that you previously download on _The Voice of the Crisis_ activity.

## Instructions

### Load the News Articles from the CSV File as a DataFrame

Pick the CSV file you created on _The Voice of the Crisis_ activity and load it as a DataFrame; remember to specify the `encoding='utf-8-sig'` parameter.

The VADER sentiment module is only trained to score sentiment on English language, so create a new DataFrame only with news in English. You will learn how to score sentiment in multiple languages later.

### Calculating VADER Sentiment Score for News Titles and Text

As you know the `compound` score could be used to get a normalized score for a sentiment, in this section you have to create a function called `get_sentiment(score)` that will return a normalized value of sentiment for the `score` parameter based on the rules you learn. This function should return `1` for positive sentiment, `-1` for negative sentiment, and `0` for neutral sentiment.

Use the the VADER sentiment module from `NLTK` to score the sentiment of every news article title and text in english; you should append ten new columns to the English news DataFrame to store the results as follows.

* Title's compound score
* Title's positive score
* Title's neutral score
* Title's negative score
* Title's normalized score (using the `get_sentiment()` function)
* Text's compound score
* Text's positive score
* Text's neutral score
* Text's negative score
* Text's normalized score (using the `get_sentiment()` function)

Your final DataFrame should look like this.

**Hint:** You can use the `iterrows()` method from the Pandas DataFrame to iterate across the rows to score the sentiment for the title an the text of each news article.

### Analyzing Sentiments Results

How the sentiment of the title and the text differs on news articles?

To answer this question, on this section you will create a bar chart contrasting the normalized sentiment for the title and the text of each news article. Use the build-in `plot()` method of the Pandas DataFrame to create a bar chart like the one bellow. Be aware that you chart might differ from this one due to is made from a different news DataFrame.

Finally get the descriptive statistics from the English news DataFrame and discuss the analysis results with your partners.
