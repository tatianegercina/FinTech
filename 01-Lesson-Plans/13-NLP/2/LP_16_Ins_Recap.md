### 16. Instructor Do: Recap (5 mins)

Take a moment to congratulate the students on wrapping up a really fun and intense week of natural language processing. Remind them that NLP and in-particular, sentiment analysis, has a lot of interesting applications in FinTech such as market prediction or products benchmarking.

Recap by asking students to summarize with one word or a 3 word phrase what they learned today. Ask for volunteers, and then eventually go round-robin if necessary.

**Answer:** Finance has emotions

**Answer:** Complexity

**Answer:** Human speech understanding

**Answer:** Algorithms measure emotions

**Answer:** Sentiments visualization

Emphasize to students how they used some of the skills they already master to work on Today's activities; sentiment analysis is a multidisciplinary area that requires not only algorithms to score sentiments of human speech, but also, data cleaning and meaningful data visualizations to present results and share insights.

Explain that NLP and sentiment analysis is still a cutting-edge research area. In particular, new deep learning techniques such as RNNs have transformed NLP and pushed it towards what we only imaged before as science fiction. Encourage students to keep learning and trying new libraries and technologies as this specialization of machine learning continues to expand.
