### 16. Instructor Do: Recap (5 mins)

Awesome you reach the end of NLP Day 2! This was perhaps a quite interesting day, students went into one of the most popular applications of natural language processing, they have demystified the idea that sentiment analysis is just for marketing and students have proved themselves how it works with hands-on coding activities.

Highlight to students that sentiment analysis is an area under development, however the tools and methods they learned Today are the foundations to get started on this area; students can be confident to give a try to any different Python library or cloud service they would like to use.

Recap by asking students to summarize with one word or a 3 word phrase what they learned today. Ask for volunteers, and then eventually go round-robin if necessary.

**Answer:** Finance has emotions

**Answer:** Complexity

**Answer:** Human speech understanding

**Answer:** Algorithms measure emotions

**Answer:** Sentiments visualization dashboard

Emphasize students how they used some of the skills they already master to work on Today's mini-project; sentiment analysis is a multidisciplinary area that requires not only algorithms to score sentiments of human speech, but also, meaningful data visualizations to present results and share insights.

Communicate to students how the activities they completed Today add value to their career development and how the mini-project contributes to expand their online portfolio.

* Students created a live sentiment analysis tool that can be reused to score sentiments about different matters of interests.

* Students also identified the benefits of sentiment analysis for FinTech professionals, definitely it's an interesting talking point during job interviews.
