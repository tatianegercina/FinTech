## 13.2 Lesson Plan - How the FinTech Feels

---

### Overview

Today's class will introduce students to **sentiment analysis**, one of the most popular applications of NLP. Normally sentiment analysis is usually related to marketing, however it's receiving a big attention on FinTech because of its huge spectrum of applications ranging from customer service, competition bench-marking, investment assistance, as well as news and social media analysis.

On this this lesson students will gain practical experience using the `NLTK` python library and the **IBM Tone Analyzer** cloud service to analyze sentiments on news feed.

### Class Objectives

By the end of the class, students will be able to:

* Identify the applications of sentiment analysis for FinTech.

* Retrieve data from news feeds to analyze sentiments and tone.

* Perform data preparation techniques oriented to sentiment analysis.

* Apply natural language processing through `NLTK` and `VADER` to classify news sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral.

* Conduct tone analysis using the **IBM Tone Analyzer** cloud service.

* Develop a sentiment analysis dashboard combining former knowledge on data visualization and the brand new skills to analyze sentiment.

### Instructor Notes

* Sentiment analysis is a wide area that has a broad range of tools, this class will cover only a gentle introduction to sentiment analysis fundamental, if you have students eager to learn more about this topic, you can share with them the additional references you will find on the [Supplemental folder](../Supplemental/).

* This lesson includes the use and demonstration of the [News API](https://newsapi.org/), a free API for developers that retrieves metadata for headlines and news. This service requires user registration, despite the process is quite easy, have your TAs to assist students during the instructor demo activity to be sure students get their API key.

* Students will use the **IBM Tone Analizer** cloud service on this class, the registration process could be time consuming, so be sure to slack out the [registration instructions](../Supplemental/ibm_tone_analizer_registration.md) prior the class to keep the class flow on track.

* This class includes a mini project activity at the end of the day where students are asked to use their previous learned skills, this could be challenging for some of them, so encourage students to work in teams to solve this activity.

* Have your TAs keep track with the [Time Tracker](TimeTracker.xlsx)
