## 24.3 Lesson Plan: Final Project Presentations!

In this class, your students will present their final projects to the class! They’ll afterward answer open-floor questions from you, TAs, and classmates. This is a **crucial** lecture for your students, so make sure you follow the advice in this plan.

##### Instructor Priorities

* Students should expect an extended class today—these presentations tend to last longer than our allotted time.

* At the end of class today, celebrate! Students have just completed an intense journal over the last 24 weeks that will likely have significant impact on their own lives. Make sure to celebrate this accomplishment with them!

### Class Objectives

* Arrive early to class so that you can set the room up for presentations: Panopto, microphone, and the rest of your equipment.

### 0. Instructor Do: Set Up Your Equipment (15 minutes before class)

Make sure to come to class and set up your laptop and other equipment. It is recommended that you prepare a list of the GitHub pages links for all deployed repos so that students can quickly launch their projects.

If students have hosted presentations on Google Slides, compile a list of those as well to avoid switching computers.

### 1. Instructor Do: Welcome Class (5 min)

Welcome students and check whether anyone has any questions before the presentations begin.

### 2. Instructor Do: Introduce Presentations (5 min)

Congratulate your class on developing their projects to a state worth presenting. Assure them that their work is incredibly complex and that they should take pride in what they've done!

Tell students to deploy their latest changes to GitHub. After this, all it will take is a quick pull to get any changes.

Ask students to send links to both their presentation and to their GitHub README.md.

Give students a rundown of how their presentations should pan out.

1. They should last about 8-10 minutes, followed by 2 to 4 minutes of open-floor Q&A. (Note: Adjust the presentation time based on your class size.)
2. They should speak **into** the microphone—this ensures that we capture high-quality audio for their recorded presentation.
3. They need to show confidence! All of them have contributed to impressive projects—they need to recognize and project that during their demonstrations.

Ask which groups would like to go first, then second, and so on. When groups stop responding, assign the remaining teams to random slots (and write this list down).

### 3. Presentations Part 1 (1 hour, 30 minutes)

* Go down the list and send each group up to the front of the class. Give students roughly 3 minutes of setup time.

* When a group nears the 9-minute mark, motion for them to draw their presentation to a close (try pointing to your wrist). Don't say anything—you don't want your voice to interrupt their talk, especially since you're recording them.

* Follow each of these presentations up with questions about their projects. Let TAs and classmates ask questions, too.

* When the Q&A session ends, stop recording. When Panopto stops, point out what you found impressive and what they can improve on for future demonstrations.

* When a group finishes afternoon, announce a break.

### 4. BREAK (40 min)

### 5. Presentations Part 2 (1 hour, 30 minutes)

Just as in step 3, send each group up to the front of the class when their turn comes.

### 6. Congratulate Students (10 min)

When the last group finishes, give them an estimate for when they can expect to have their recorded presentations. Tell each of them that they should put their demonstrations up on LinkedIn along with links to their GitHub repositories.

Congratulate them! It's challenging to conceive, develop, and present a new FinTech project! Remind them how much they've learned over the past 6 months.
