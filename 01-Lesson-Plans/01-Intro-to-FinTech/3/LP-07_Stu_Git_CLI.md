### 7. Students Do: GitHub Re-Organized (15 min)

**Instructions:**

* [README.md](Activities/02-Stu_Git_CLI/README.md)

### 8. Instructor Do: Review Git (10 min)

* Ask students for any questions they may have and take a few minutes to review any commands which weren't clear. Offer to help students with this throughout the day and during office hours.

* Explain to students that this will be the new, primary way of submitting homework to GitHub (no more manual uploads!).

* Reassure them that it's ok if this takes some time to figure out. By the end of the course, they will be git ninjas!

* Encourage students to continue to add and commit their activities today into a repo for additional practice.
