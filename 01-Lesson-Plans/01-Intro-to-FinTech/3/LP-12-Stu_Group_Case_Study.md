### 12. Students Do: FinTech Groups (30 mins)

In this activity, students will be divided up into groups of `4-5` individuals with each group representing a FinTech case study of a particular company. Each group will have to create their own shared GitHub repository and collaboratively create a case study report written in markdown.

**Instructions:**

* [README.md](Activities/04-Stu_Group_Case_Study/README.md)

### 13. Instructor Do: Review FinTech Groups (20 mins)

Perform the following:

* Explain to students that now that they've worked together to create their FinTech case studies, they should finish off with a presentation of their findings. Have each group present their findings to the class and give each group approximately `4-5` minutes per presentation.

* Have students log into their shared GitHub repository and present off of the FinTech case study content written in the `README` markdown file.

* Make sure that all students have a say in the group presentations. Most likely, there will be some students who are shy when it comes to presenting -- try to bring them out of their comfort zones?

* When presentations are finished, check the pulse of the class. Ask the students if they have any questions regarding the FinTech case studies and if they enjoyed their group activity.

* Lastly, remind students that the homework for Unit 1 will be a FinTech case study. Therefore, students can leverage what they already have as a group to complete the more comprehensive requirements of the Unit 1 homework.
