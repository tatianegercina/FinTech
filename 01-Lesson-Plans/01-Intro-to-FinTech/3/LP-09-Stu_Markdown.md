### 9. Students Do: Git Welcome (15 mins)

In this activity, students visually enhance their `README` files for their GitHub repositories by adding additional markdown features.

**Instructions:**

* [README.md](Activities/03-Stu_Markdown/README.md)

### 10. Instructor Do: Git Welcome (5 mins)

Perform the following:

* Explain to the students that having a well formatted `README` file helps to better showcase the contents of a GitHub repository; markdown syntax provides additional features for text formatting, links, images, and code snippets among other things. 

* Remind students that markdown is a common `README` format and renders on a webpage via specific syntax.

* Reassure students that using markdown syntax is as easy as using the correct syntactical key word or term. For example, the `![]()` syntax is used specifically for linking images to the markdown file. 

* Encourage students to continue building their GitHub `README` files as they progress through the course, particularly when they begin generating coding assets. Ideally, their GitHub repository `README` should look like that of a professional's by the end of this course.
