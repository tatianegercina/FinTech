**Instructions**

    * Add new lines of code to one of the python files.
    * Create a new folder.
    * Add a file to the newly created folder.
    * Add, commit and push the changes.
    * Delete the new folder.
    * Add, commit and push the changes again.

### 7. Instructor Do: Review Git (10 min)

Ask students for any questions students may have and take a few minutes to review any commands which weren't clear. Offer to help students with this throughout the day and during office hours.

Explain to students that this will be the new, primary way of submitting homework to GitHub (no more manual uploads!).

Reassure them that it's ok if this take some time to figure out. By the end of the course, they will be git ninjas!

Encourage students to continue to add and commit their activities today into a repo for additional practice.
