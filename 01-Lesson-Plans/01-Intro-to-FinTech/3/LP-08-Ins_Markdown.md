**Files:** [slideshow-placeholder]()

Open the slideshow and present the following questions and answers:

* What is Markdown?

  > Markdown is a lightweight markup language that contains syntax for adding formatting elements to plain text documents.

* Why use Markdown?

  > Markdown provides features for created visually enhanced documents that are rendered on the web, most commonly used for documents such as README files or online forum discussion posts. 

* What are some common Markdown features?

  * Text Formatting

  * Header Formatting

  * Line Breaks

  * Code snippets

  * Block quotes

  * Links

  * Images

Then, live demo the following while explaining the following points:

* Go to your local git repository and modify the `README` file. Notice there was already a `#` in front of the `README` title! That's why the font looked larger in the GitHub webpage. Markdown can create text headers with `#`, `##`, `###...`, where `#` represents size header 1 and `###...` repesents size header 3 and so on.
