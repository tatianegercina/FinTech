# Case Study Proposal: Shopify, democratizing e-commerce

## What Is It

Shopify is a Canadian multi-channel e-commerce company that provides merchants with online services to start and manage their businesses as fast as one day.

This platform allows sellers to create an online store in a few clicks and without code using its online store builder. Since it's a cloud service, Shopify deals with all the technical and security matters to allow merchants to focus on offering their products and services online.

In February 2020, Shopify announces that it joined Libra Association, the organization behind Facebook's stable coin Libra, as an effort to make e-commerce more affordable in parts of the world where money and banking could be far better.

## Why This Matters

E-commerce is moving into a new era were launching a product as fast as possible is more crucial than ever; moreover, becoming mobile-first is a must! Since its early years, Shopify is committed to offering a human-friendly platform for people interested in selling online. They offer an entirely usable platform that makes it easy to create an online store, add products, and tweak the website's look and feel so that merchants can focus their energy on building their business instead of building their website.

Selling goods or services online, sometimes seems complex and impossible to accomplish specially for small companies or independent sellers. Shopify is committed to its mission "Making commerce better for everyone," by allowing people to have a multi-channel selling offers by using Shopify's online store and it's built-in integrations with Amazon, Facebook Shop, and Facebook Messenger.

As a member of the Libra Association, Shopify will work collectively to democratize online payments by contributing to building a payment network that makes money easier to access and supports merchants and consumers everywhere.

## Why This May be Interesting

Since 2004, Shopify grew from five people in a coffee shop to over 5,000 employees across the globe. With more than 1,000,000 businesses worldwide powered by Shopify nowadays, from 2016 to 2018, global companies on Shopify contributed $183 billion in economic activity worldwide.

It's interesting how an e-commerce platform is having an impact in the modern economy, and it's democratizing e-commerce, simplifying it, and making it accessible for businesses of all sizes.
