# Case Study Proposal:  How Starbucks Wants to Connect Coffee Consumers with Coffee Producers

## What Is It

Starbucks is piloting a blockchain technology in partnership with Microsoft, to keep track of the journey that its coffee beans make from farms to the coffee cup you drink each morning.

## Why This Matters

This case is an example of how a consumer company is looking to innovate through technology to offer a better experience to its consumers, by the time it's also providing transparent information about the origin of their coffee beans.

Starbucks is working on a new feature for its mobile app that will show customers information about where what is the origin of their packaged coffee. Customers will be able to know using the app where the coffee beans they are enjoying were grown and what the company is doing to support farmers in those locations, also where and when it was roasted, tasting notes, and more.

## Why This May be Interesting

* Starbucks has long been committed to ethical sourcing for its coffee beans digital, real-time traceability using blockchain technology will allow customers to know more about how they are contributing by dinking their coffee cup, and coffee farmers will know where their beans go after they sell them.

* This new transparency blockchain-based system will allow supply chain participants to trace both the movement of their coffee and its transformation from bean to final bag.

* Each state change is recorded to a shared, immutable ledger providing all parties a complete view of their products' journey.

## Things to Keep in Mind for a Case Study

* How coffee supply chain works at a glance, and how Starbucks makes this journey different.

* What technologies are using Starbucks to implement this solution.

* How a blockchain can offer transparency to all stakeholders in a supply chain.
