# Case Study Proposal: ClearScore, Helping Australians Reach Their Financial Goals Using Artificial Intelligence

## What Is It

ClearScore is a FinTech company operating in Australia, India, South Africa and the UK. The key service of ClearScore is a free credit score and report based on the Equifax credit score. The Equifax credit score computed by ClearScore is generated directly from Equifax.

All the financial services provided by ClearScore are free of charge; after analyzing the credit profile of a customer, ClearScore offers custom financial products recommendations from  different companies including creadit cards, loans and car finance offers. If a customer takes one of their recommendations, that company pays a referral fee to ClearScore.

ClearScore was one of the first FinTech companies in the credit scoring space to make use of chatbots, introducting a bot called "Coaching". Chatbots are based on the machine learning technology called Natural Language Processing, which is one of the major areas of study in the field. ClearScore's Coaching chatbot aims to help customers improve their credit worthiness and ability to get the best financial deals available. By interacting with customers, it will determine their credit worthiness and determine what steps the user can take to imrpove their credit score and make good financial decisions.

## Why This Matters

Credit scores are crucial for any person interested in getting credit, a loan, or a mortgage; however, most credit scores companies, like Equifax, require payment of a fee or annual subscriptions. For an individual to get a credit score for free, as well as free financial advice, is a great advantage and opportunity to improve the financial side of their life.

## Why This May be Interesting

Using artificial intelligence, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and financial behaviour data analysis, ClearScore is not only offering free credit scores to Australians but also providing financial education.

One of the central uses of NLP is *sentiment analysis* - that is, rating each communication from a customer from -1 (negative) to 1 (positive). This will help flag customers for support, and identify parts of the business offering that are well received or need improvement. It is central in automated customer support. This idea has wide application across many industries.

Thanks to the use of chatbots, ClearScore is contributing to closing the gap between financial companies looking for customers and people who might not know where to start when looking for steps to improve their credit score and choose the right financial products to help them do so.

ClearScore launched in Australia in early 2020, and has 8.5m users in the UK and 2.5m more across India and South Africa. According to the company, they focused on two central things: always placing the user at the centre of what we do, and fostering a culture of innovation within the team.
