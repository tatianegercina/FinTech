# Case Study Proposal: Payslip Fraud detection using machine learning at Commonwealth Bank of Australia

## What Is It

When customers apply for larger loans and mortgages, they usually have to supply supporting documentation to prove that they hold the assets and receive the income they claim. The financial institution must verify that these documents are legitimate as one of the steps in granting the loan request. Machine learning tools can help the bank's fraud detection team focus on the most likely fraudulent documents - it would be impossible to examine them all thoroughly. These tools can also be adapted as the methods of the fraudsters change over time.

This is just one of many types of fraud that a bank is exposed to, including money laundering, scamming, phishing, credit card scams, internal fraud - the list goes on.

## Why This Matters

Due to the large number of loan requests, the increasing proportion of documentation done online and the increasingly sophisticated nature of individuals and criminal syndicates attempting to perpetrate fraud, financial institutions are obliged to use more and more powerful tools to detect fraud. As lending is one of the banks primary functions and one of its greatest risks, it is essential to mitigate the exposure to fraud.

## Why This May be Interesting

The machine learning techniques used span the subject, from machine vision, optical character recognition (OCR), outlier detection. The algos developed are a pipeline of several of these components. The outputs are equally varied. One could associate a probability of fraud to an application, rank the applications in decreasing order of suspiciousness so that the fraud detection team can work on the most likely cases, or classify the applications into several categories.

Furthermore, apart from detecting possible fraud cases in loan applications, any such system could be adapted to handle other types of fraud - credit card fraud, for example.

## Things to Keep in Mind for a Case Study

* The volume of loan and mortgage applications made to CommBank.

* Importance of fraud detection to banks.

* Pros and cons of automated fraudulent document detection.

* The various sub-fields of machine learning that can be applied to this problem.

* The difference in real-world outcomes between false positives and false negatives when classifying an application as fraudulent.
