# Case Study Proposal: CoinSpot, one of Australia's earliest cryptocurrency exchanges

## What Is It

CoinSpot is an Australian-based exchange, founded in 2013, that allows you to easily buy, sell or trade more than 100 cryptocurrencies. Users can securely buy, sell and trade a portfolio of digital currencies, including Ethereum, Litecoin, and Ripple online, using the web and mobile applications.

## Why This Matters

In the last few years, there has been a great increase in the number of cryptocurrencies based on blockchain, and their application is spreading further into general economic activity

There are several trading platforms where people can trade digital currency. Nevertheless trading your money in a platform in another country could feel risky. CoinSpot is a trading platform based in Melbourne that is focused on the Australian market, is compliant with Australian regulations, and is aimed to close the safety and complexity gap perceived especially by people that are starting trading or investing in crypto.

## Why This May be Interesting

Cryptocurrencies are becoming more popular in Australia - especially Bitcoin. For instance, Australians searched for "Bitcoin" more then "Banks" in 2019.

The government and Australian banks are also striving to increase and strengthen cryptocurrency regulations. If you consider these efforts and all the start-ups in Melbourne, Sydney and elsewhere, it would appear that Bitcoin is here to stay and using crypto is going to become more common in the coming years.

However, a survey of consumer trends by the Reserve Bank of Australia found that 80% of Australians know about cryptocurrencies, but only about 1% use it to transact business. This is in contrast to overseas markets such as Canada, where one can even pay municipal taxes in some cities. This could suggest that the crypto market in Australia is on the cusp of a great expansion.
