# FinTech Groups

In this activity, you will need to establish groups and collaboratively create a FinTech case study report written in markdown and hosted on a shared GitHub repository.

## Instructions

Walk through the following steps:

  * Formulate groups. Each class should have `4-5` groups. For example, a class of `30` students should be divided into `5` groups of `6` students.

  * Navigate to the class GitHub repository and choose one of the available FinTech case study proposals.

  * Create a new shared GitHub repository and add each of your group members to the repo.

  * Research your particular FinTech case and provide answers to the following:

    * What is the background of your company? What do they do? Who are their competitors?

    * How does this company use technology to their advantage? Why are they called a "FinTech" company?

    * Why is this company exemplary in the FinTech space? What are their strengths and weaknesses?

    * What is the prognosis for this company? Where do they expect to be in the future?

  * Modify the `README` file to include the minimum requirements (your group can add additional markdown features if desired):

    * `H1 Title`: A title for the FinTech case study.

    * `Image`: An image relevant to the case study.

    * `H2 Description`: A description header.

    * `Description Content`: Content for the description

    * `Contributors`: Named contributors/members of the group

    * `H3 FinTech Case Study Report`: A title for the FinTech case study report

    * `FinTech Case Study Content`: Content for the FinTech case study

  * Push the changes to the shared GitHub repository.

  * Navigate to the shared GitHub repository and confirm the changes.

## Hints

* If you plan on having individuals in your group working on the same file at the same time (rather than one person typing out the entirety of the report), be aware of merge conflicts. In other words, students will need to be careful modifying the same file and creating separate **versions** of the file, in which case git will not know which version takes precedence.
