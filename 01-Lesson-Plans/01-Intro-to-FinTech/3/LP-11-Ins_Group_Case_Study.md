### 11. Instructor Do: Group Case Study (10 min)

In this activity, students will combine their knowledge of the git CLI and markdown syntax to collaboratively create a group FinTech case study on a shared GitHub repository. 

**Files:** [slideshow-placeholder]()

Open the slideshow and go over slides 1-22 while explaining the following:

* Now that students know how to manage their own GitHub repositories and create text formatted markdown files, they can move on to creating shared repositories in which multiple people collaborate to create a group case study report.

* Git repositories are often shared and have multiple collaborators; the group case study mini-project will showcase this scenario.

* Students should pair off into groups of 4-5 individuals and choose one of the available FinTech companies to present.

* Remind students that they shold look to the class GitHub repository to find samples of existing FinTech case studies to model off of.

* Energize your students! This will be a good time for students to interact with each other and build upon what they've learned to perform their own independent case study analyses (without teacher help).
