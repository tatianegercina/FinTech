### 3. Students Do: GitHub README (15 mins)

In this activity, students will emulate the preceding instructor activity by creating their own git repositories and modifying their README.md files to personalize their GitHub repositories. Additionally, they will begin organizing their repositories by setting up a folder hierarchy. 

**Instructions:**

* [README.md](Activities/01-Stu_Refresher/README.md)

### 4. Instructor Do: GitHub README (5 mins)

Highlight the following points when it comes to setting up a git repository and modifying the README:

* Make sure to intialize the new GitHub repository with a `README.md` file. Otherwise, deployment of the repository will be halted until further setup is completed.

* When downloading the GitHub repository as a `.zip` file, contents will have to first be extracted in order to edit any of the files.

* Navigating through the terminal and performing edits via the command-line may seem unfamiliar and inefficient at first; however, most veteran developers will agree that familiarity with the terminal is critical as it demonstrates a developer's understanding of low-level functions and provides an interactive shell when no graphical user interface (GUI) exists. For example, when connecting remotely to another machine via the SSH or Secure Shell Protocol.

* After modifying the `README.md` file on the local file system, changed files will have to be pushed or re-uploaded to the online repository.

* GitHub should automatically be able to preview `.md` or *markdown* files, as they contain style formatting elements, and therefore should immediately reflect the changes of the updated `README.md` file. If not, manually refresh the page.
