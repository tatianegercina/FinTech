## 1.3 Lesson Plan - FinTech Collaboration

---

### Overview

In today's class, students will learn how to utilize the Git Command Line Interface (CLI) and create markdown files to generate FinTech case studies that can be collaboratively stored, accessed/modified, and previewed on an online git or file repository such as Github. A solid understanding of the git CLI as well as knowing how to create markdown files will serve students in helping them properly manage git repositories and construct visually enhanced README description files. 

### Class Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Configure the git CLI user credentials from the terminal
* Comprehend the notion of git clone and local/remote branches
* Modify git repositories by adding, committing, and pushing files
* Create markdown files and implement its additional visual capabilities: text formatting, images, links
* Collaboratively write a FinTech case study in markdown, hosted on an online git repository 

### Instructor Notes

* Students may feel uneasy as today's lesson will continue their journey of using the terminal to interact with not just files on their local file system, but also files that are actively tracked via an online repository. Ease students' nerves by telling them that git is merely a command line tool -- a program that exists on the local file system that executes from the command line/terminal.

* Make sure that by the end of class students have the tools to create well-presented markdown README files to host on their git repositories. They'll need these to showcase their git repositories (and the coding assets within) to potential employers in the future.

* Students will need to have a good understanding of git branches and merges in order to effectively collaborate with others working in the same git repository. Otherwise, students may face merge conflicts that prevent them from pushing their file changes to the git repository.

* Be mindful of students working in groups during the case study activity; some students may be less vocal than others. Walk around the room with the other TAs and try to make sure every student is actively engaged and has a voice in their respective groups.

* Have your TAs keep track with the [Time Tracker](TimeTracker.xlsx)

Welcome students to the third day of FinTech! Cover the following points:

* The previous lessons focused on introducing students to the FinTech course structure and discussed the history and current landscape of the FinTech ecosystem, as well as notable case studies of technological disruptors. Today students will combine what they've learned so far on the FinTech industry to collaboratively create their own FinTech case studies that can be hosted on online git repositories and previewed as visually enhanced markdown files.

* Mention to the class that today's goal is two-fold: one, to teach students how to manage their own git repositories as well as develop in shared ones, and two, to develop text-based assets (such as a FinTech case study) in markdown to provide visually appealing README files that can be previewed on the GitHub website (and showcased to potential employers). 

* Students will be put into groups and given a selection of FinTech case study proposals to choose from. Therefore, students will need to work collaboratively and generate a visually appealing document that can be hosted online -- that's where git CLI and markdown comes in! 

* Energize your students! Today they'll be learning the same collaborative tools (git) that real developers and industry professionals use to share and build upon code.
