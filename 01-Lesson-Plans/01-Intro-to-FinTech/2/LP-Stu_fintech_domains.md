### Student Do: Investigate trends/domains

* We have now given students examples of both the major domains within fintech as well as ongoing trends in the field. Now it is their turn to do some research and discuss amongst their groups about what they've learned.

* Give students the following instructions:

```
    You've just learned what the major domains and trends in fintech are, and now it's your turn to begin investigating and discussing some of the areas we've just covered. 

    What areas are you most interested in, and why?

    What areas are those around you most interested in?

    Were there any domains that we left out? (Hint: e.g. RegTech) If so, what are some other domains of note?

    Be prepared for a light class discussion!
