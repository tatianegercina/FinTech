### Instructor Do: Clone and SSH debugging

* Now that we have introduced students to terminal commands, let's work on getting them set up for class.

* First, ask for a show of hands for those that have not yet finished the prework instructions for setting up their SSH keys. Although this is not the most chiefly important thing they will do today, assure them that the TA's will work with them to resolve the issues during this next activity.

* Second, walk them through the process of performing a `git clone` of the class repository. Assure them that we will cover what this "git" thing is in more detail on the next class period.

    * Go to the *class* repository and copy the HTTPS link. (Please use HTTPS as it is more likely to not be blocked by campus firewalls)
    
    * In the terminal, run a `git clone` and paste the link. While it is cloning, explain to students that cloning a repository is the process by which you copy all of the contents of a remote "folder" of sorts. The main difference is that we can constantly update this folder with new content as we progress throughout the course. If it helps, you can compare it to a cloud service like Dropbox, except we will do updates using commands in the terminal. 

    * We don't have time at the moment to cover all of the complexities of git, but we will spend more time on it on Saturday, and continue to learn about the technology over the extent of the course.

### Student Do: Clone class repository

* You will need to clone the class repository to your machine similar to the process your instructor has just demonstrated:

* Go to the class repository and copy the HTTPS link. (Please use HTTPS as it is more likely to not be blocked by campus firewalls)

* In the terminal (Git Bash for Windows), run a `git clone <paste link here>` 

* If the folder exists on your machine when the terminal command stops running; Congrats, you've successfully cloned the class repo!
