### Student Do: Find your own case study!

* Now it's the students' turn! they should spend the next 30-40 minutes researching case studies in the field and discovering what areas they may want to explore during their homework case studies. 

* Break students into groups of 3-4, and assign them companies and technologies from the list below to investigate:

    - Stripe
    - Plaid
    - Android Pay
    - Apple Pay
    - Square
    - Braintree

* Emphasize that the secondary goal of this activity is to hone students' communication and presentation skills. 
  * Point out the importance of these soft skills in the fintech career space and give specific examples in your own careers where you've had to utilize them. 
  
* Point out other things students should be aware of as they gather research and put together their presentations. Namely: 
  * Think about the audience; i.e. fellow students like themselves who are new to the fintech space. As such, they should communicate in language that's easy to understand and avoid using too many esoteric terms. In cases, where specific terms are necesary, make sure that they are defined. 
  * Think about slide design. Good slides are not "busy" slides, and as such are not overloaded with text or too many images. Students should be cognizant of what is relevant to their slides vs. what is content that they will verbalize.
  
* Also point out that each person in the group is expected to speak during the presentation. Emphasize the importance of public speaking, and let students know that there will be more opportunities throughout the course for them to present on various fintech topics. 

* Below are links to previous fintech presentations. Feel free to use them to point what's working in the presentation and what's not: 
  * None yet!
  
* Send students the following instructions over Slack. 

* **Instructions:**

  * Working in groups of three or four, you will be assigned a fintech company or technology. Your task is to: Prepare a 5 minute presentation that provides an overview of the topic.

  * You should focus on answering the following questions...

    * What is or was the technology or company?
    * What market inefficiency does it hope to exploit or improve?
    * What impact has the technology had on its sector or the field of finance in general?

* **Notes:**

  * While you may be new to the field challenge yourself to “become the expert.” A huge part of being a professional is getting up to speed quickly on technical situations using research.

  * For those uncomfortable about the idea of presenting, challenge yourself to treat this as a safe place. Becoming a confident speaker is an important part of being a fintech consultant that people can trust.
