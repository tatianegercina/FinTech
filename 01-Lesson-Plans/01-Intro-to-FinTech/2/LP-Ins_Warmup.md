### X. Everyone Do: Warmup (10 mins) [Optional]

* Welcome to the first full day of class! As students are just getting in, we'll start off with an easy discussion. 

* Give the class a few minutes to ponder about the question: what financial technology do you think will have the most impact in 10 years, and why? 

* Do give students a chance to dream big, but try not to overshoot the time mark with discussion.
