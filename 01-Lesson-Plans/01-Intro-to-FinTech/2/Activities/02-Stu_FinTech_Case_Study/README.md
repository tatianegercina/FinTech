* **Instructions:**

  * Working in groups of three or four, you will be assigned a fintech company or technology. Your task is to: Prepare a 5 minute presentation that provides an overview of the topic.

  * You should focus on answering the following questions...

    * What is or was the technology or company?
    * What market inefficiency does it hope to exploit or improve?
    * What impact has the technology had on its sector or the field of finance in general?

* **Notes:**

  * While you may be new to the field challenge yourself to “become the expert.” A huge part of being a professional is getting up to speed quickly on technical situations using research.

  * For those uncomfortable about the idea of presenting, challenge yourself to treat this as a safe place. Becoming a confident speaker is an important part of being a fintech consultant that people can trust.
