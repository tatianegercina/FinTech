# FinTech Payments Case Study

Now it's your turn to create and present a case study! Break off into groups of `3-4` individuals again and research one of the following competitors to Stripe in the Payments domain:

 * Plaid
 
 * Android Pay
 
 * Apple Pay
 
 * Square
 
 * Braintree

## Instructions

Research the following questions:

  * What is or was the technology or company?
  
  * What market inefficiency does it hope to exploit or improve?
  
  * What impact has the technology had on its sector or the field of finance in general?

## Hints

  * While you may be new to the field challenge yourself to “become the expert.” A huge part of being a professional is getting up to speed quickly on technical situations using research.

  * For those uncomfortable about the idea of presenting, challenge yourself to treat this as a safe place. Becoming a confident speaker is an important part of being a fintech consultant that people can trust.
