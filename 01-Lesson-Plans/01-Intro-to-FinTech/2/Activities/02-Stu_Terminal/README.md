# File System Operations

It's time to try out the command line for yourself. Use the command line, or terminal, to perform common file system operations.

## Instructions

Complete the following steps using the command line:

  * Open Terminal (Mac) or Git Bash (Windows).

  * Check your current working directory.

  * Navigate to your desktop.

  * Confirm that your current working directory is the desktop.

  * Create a folder called `Pets`.

  * Navigate into the `Pets` folder.

  * Inside `Pets`, create two folders: `Dogs` and `Cats`.

  * Navigate into the `Cats` folder.

  * Create a file named `name.txt` and insert the text `My name is Lucky! Bark!`. Then save the file.

  * Read the file `name.txt` and output the results to the console.

  * Navigate back to the root of the `Pets` folder.

  * Copy the file `name.txt` into the `Dogs` folder.

  * Delete the `Cats` folder and its contents.

  * Rename the folder `Dogs` to `Lucky`.

  * List the contents of the root of the `Pets` folder.

## Hints

* Use the [CommonCommands.sh](Unsolved/CommonCommands.sh) file for reference if you need help performing these file system operations.

* Use the `mv` operation to rename files or folders.
