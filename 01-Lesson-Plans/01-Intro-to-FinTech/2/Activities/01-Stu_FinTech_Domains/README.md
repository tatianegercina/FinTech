# FinTech Headlines

Now that you've learned about some of the major trends/domains that have disrupted and lead us to the current state of the FinTech ecosystem, it's time to think about how these FinTech domains might progress in the future given their current trajectories.

Form groups of 3-4 individuals to brainstorm and produce headlines for each FinTech domain (6 headlines for 6 domains) that one might expect to see in the news within the next 2-3 years.

## Instructions

Research each FinTech domain to produce news headlines that fit the following criteria:

* Headlines should represent an event, outcome, or characteristic of each FinTech domain happening within the next 2-3 years.

* Example headlines might be the future event of a specific company, a sociopolitical outcome as a result of the disruption involved within the respective FinTech domain, or a continuing FinTech trend.

* Headlines should have at least minimal research to support the feasibility of the headline.

Be prepared to participate in a class discussion!

## Hint

Remember to think about the current trends affecting each FinTech domain in order to extrapolate and devise a potential news headlines representing the environment of the next 2-3 years.
