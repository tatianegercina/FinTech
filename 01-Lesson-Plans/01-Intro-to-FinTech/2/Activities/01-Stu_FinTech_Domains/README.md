# Investigate FinTech Domains

You've just learned what the major domains and trends in fintech are, and now it's your turn to begin investigating and discussing some of the areas we've just covered.

## Instructions

Look into the the following questions:

  * What areas are you most interested in, and why?

  * What areas are those around you most interested in?

  * Were there any domains that we left out? (Hint: e.g. RegTech) If so, what are some other domains of note?

  * Be prepared for a light class discussion!
