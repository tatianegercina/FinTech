  * Check your current working directory.

  * Navigate to your Desktop.

  * Confirm your current working directory is at the Desktop.

  * Create a folder called `Pets`.

  * Navigate into the folder.

  * Inside `Pets`, create two folders: `Dogs` and `Cats`.

  * Navigate into `Cats`.

  * Create a file named `name.txt` and insert the text `My name is Lucky! Bark!`, save the file.

  * Read the file `name.txt` and output the results to the console.

  * Navigate back to the root of the `Pets` folder.

  * Copy the file `name.txt` into `Dogs`.

  * Delete the folder `Cats` and its contents.
