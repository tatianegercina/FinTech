It's time to try out the terminal/command line for yourself! Use the terminal to perform common file system operations.

## Instructions

Walk through the following steps:

  * Open your terminal (Mac) or git-bash (Windows).

  * Check your current working directory.

  * Navigate to your Desktop.

  * Confirm your current working directory is at the Desktop.

  * Create a folder called `Terminal-Test`.

  * Navigate into the folder.

  * Inside `Terminal-Test`, create two folders: `Folder_1` and `Folder_2`.

  * Navigate into `Folder_1`.

  * Create a file named `terminal.txt` and insert the text `First time for everything!`, save the file.

  * Read the file `terminal.txt` and output the results to the console.

  * Navigate back to the root of the `Terminal-Test` folder.

  * Copy the file `terminal.txt` into `Folder_2`.

  * Delete the folder `Folder_1` and its contents.

  * Rename the folder `Folder_2` to `Hello_World`.

  * List the contents of the root of the `Terminal-Test` folder.
