### X. Everyone Do: Warmup (10 mins) [Optional]

* Welcome to the first full day of class! As students are just getting in, we'll start off with an easy discussion. 

* Give the class a few minutes to ponder about the question: what financial technology do you think will have the most impact in 10 years, and why? 

* Do give students a chance to dream big, but try not to overshoot the time mark with discussion.

---

### 1. Instructor Do: Welcome and Goals (5 mins)

* Get off to a great start! Make sure to welcome students to class (using as many names as you can remember), and cover the goals outlined in today's LP

---

### Instructor do: evolution of fintech

* After welcoming students to class, we're going to dive headfirst into a brief history of fintech, and how it has become increasingly relevant of late.

* Remind students that although technology in finance isn't know, for the scope of this class we're focused on the more recent developments in the field.

* Dot-com bubble: The run-up to the early 2000's dot-com bubble can be characterized as having three main features that are helpful to understanding today's environement:

    * Lots of free-flowing capital - Speaks for itsself. Investors were throwing money around due to a reduction in the capital gains tax (Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997)

    * Rise in tech talent - The bubble in capital also 

    * Lack of regulation of tech - the rise of services like Napster and LimeWire proved that technology was finally getting to the point that it _far_ outpaced regulatory agencies' ability to understand what they were and how to fairly regulate them.

    * When the dust cleared, some of the brands you recognize today had weathered the storm: Paypal, 

* Great Recession
* 07 - 18/19: company breakouts

### Instructor Do: Fintech Trends/Domains

* In the next few slides, we will be introducing students to some of the major domains of fintech - focusing on the main ones which we will cover in this course

* Payments

    * By far the largest segment at the moment, mobile and internet payments have been increasingly important with the rise of web companies and monbile devices.

    * In general, these technologies reduce friction of peer-to-peer payments without the need for a bank to be involved. These systems are designed to be more convienent than cash, and significantly faster than checks.

    * Payments, _especially_ credit cards, are largely built on older technologies that could be disrupted in a variety of ways in order to reduce friction and increase payment approval speeds

    * Examples: Venmo, Stripe, PayPal, Square, Apple Pay, Android Pay, Amazon Payments, Plaid, Zelle, most Cryptos

* Investment Management

    * A broad area that promises both individuals and institutions better management of wealth in addition to applications for algorithmic trading.

    * Betterment, Acorns, Robinhood, Quantlab

* Capital Investment

    * growth of alternate modes for financing larger projects

    * IndieGoGo, Kickstarter, Kiva, eREIT's


* Enterprise Solutions

    * companies need better tech for a large variety of different things

    * Equifax NeuroDecision, JPM Coin, BofA Quartz, Analytics, Fraud detection

* Insurance

    * Insurance agencies looking to cut costs can reduce the number of physical locations they have, as well as taking advantage of new data sources in order to better understand their clients

    * Area is slow to adapt new technologies due to heavy regulation, but better use of machine learning and statistics could provide pathway to higher profit margins

    * Examples: Lemondade

* Deposits

    * Similar to insurance agencies, many banks are looking for ways to cut costs while providing more/better services.
    
    * Examples: CapitalOne, Ally
    
* Many, many more! (Finance is a very broad field and technology continues to change how it looks!)

* Now that we've covered the major domains of fintech, we will next dive into currently growing trends in the across all of the fields:

* Mobile accessibility is a must: The rise of smartphones has made it a requirement that any new technology be accessible through a mobile site or app

* Use of machine learning and/or AI: With the advent of more powerful processors and cheaper memory, the applications of machine learning have enabled even faster calculations and more accurate predictions than ever berfore.  

* Fintech as a social good: A few of the big players such as Kiva and Lemonade are building companies that not only make profit, but also promote or fund nonprofits

* Banks have skin in the game: Although many would like to paint the picture that banks are completely ignorant of the rise of fintech, it couldn't be further than the truth. Many of the largest banks are internally funding a multitude of fintech projects in order to stay ahead of the curve!

---

### Student Do: Investigate trends/domains

* We have now given students examples of both the major domains within fintech as well as ongoing trends in the field. Now it is their turn to do some research and discuss amongst their groups about what they've learned.

* Give students the following instructions:

```
    You've just learned what the major domains and trends in fintech are, and now it's your turn to begin investigating and discussing some of the areas we've just covered. 

    What areas are you most interested in, and why?

    What areas are those around you most interested in?

    Were there any domains that we left out? (Hint: e.g. RegTech) If so, what are some other domains of note?

    Be prepared for a light class discussion!
```

### Student Do: Find your own case study!

* Now it's the students' turn! they should spend the next 30-40 minutes researching case studies in the field and discovering what areas they may want to explore during their homework case studies. 

* Break students into groups of 3-4, and assign them companies and technologies from the list below to investigate:

    - Stripe
    - Plaid
    - Android Pay
    - Apple Pay
    - Square
    - Braintree

* Emphasize that the secondary goal of this activity is to hone students' communication and presentation skills. 
  * Point out the importance of these soft skills in the fintech career space and give specific examples in your own careers where you've had to utilize them. 
  
* Point out other things students should be aware of as they gather research and put together their presentations. Namely: 
  * Think about the audience; i.e. fellow students like themselves who are new to the fintech space. As such, they should communicate in language that's easy to understand and avoid using too many esoteric terms. In cases, where specific terms are necesary, make sure that they are defined. 
  * Think about slide design. Good slides are not "busy" slides, and as such are not overloaded with text or too many images. Students should be cognizant of what is relevant to their slides vs. what is content that they will verbalize.
  
* Also point out that each person in the group is expected to speak during the presentation. Emphasize the importance of public speaking, and let students know that there will be more opportunities throughout the course for them to present on various fintech topics. 

* Below are links to previous fintech presentations. Feel free to use them to point what's working in the presentation and what's not: 
  * None yet!
  
* Send students the following instructions over Slack. 

* **Instructions:**

  * Working in groups of three or four, you will be assigned a fintech company or technology. Your task is to: Prepare a 5 minute presentation that provides an overview of the topic.

  * You should focus on answering the following questions...

    * What is or was the technology or company?
    * What market inefficiency does it hope to exploit or improve?
    * What impact has the technology had on its sector or the field of finance in general?

* **Notes:**

  * While you may be new to the field challenge yourself to “become the expert.” A huge part of being a professional is getting up to speed quickly on technical situations using research.

  * For those uncomfortable about the idea of presenting, challenge yourself to treat this as a safe place. Becoming a confident speaker is an important part of being a fintech consultant that people can trust.

  ### Instructor do: Payments Case Study - Stripe

* As students are coming back from break, let them know that we're going to deep-dive into a case study as an example of what we'd like to see in their final report for the homework this week.

* For this case study, we have decided to cover the payment processing known as Stripe, Inc. Not only does it allow us to discuss the ubiquitous world of online payments, Stripe is also an examplar of how a company can generate significant profits by lowing barriers of entry for other businesses.

* When we go to a website, we often take for granted how easy it is to pay for goods and services. Behind the scenes, there has to be a payment processor that walks through the entire ACH (Automated clearing house) submittal process with an operator, verifies payment info, verifies the transaction, communicate with both the bank and the credit card issuer to greenlight the transaction, and notify the end-user of a success or failure. In addition, that system also needs to verify the handshakes between all of those systems and institutions, make sure that every step along the way is secure, and ensure that it is resistant to errors in transmission.

* Oh, and did we also mention it has to be fast? Users tend to become _exceptionally_ anxious if it takes more than 3 seconds to load a page, and studies show that more than half of your users will leave if you don't meet that bar.

* As a programmer facing all of these technical issues, it would be _super_ awesome if someone were to swoop in and take 90% of the work for this off your hands. Enter Stripe.

* Stripe is a payment processing company founded in 2011 that provides a tiny, 8-line set of code that takes the load off of building a payment system into most android, iOS, and web applications. For this service, Stripe charges a relatively small fee on processed payments.

* By integrating Stripe, a developer can dramatically increase their development speeds, while *trust*ing that Stripe will handle much of the security and performance of payments. Anyone building a modern application will likely lean on Stripe as a go-to solution for the first implementation of their application, which has had great financial benefits for Stripe and their target users (developers).

* Stripe is by no means the only pony in town for this service though! Companies such as Plaid, PayPal (through Braintree), Square, and more have developed their own, similar solutions.

### 2. Instructor Do: Anaconda Terminal (10 mins) (Critical)

* **Files:**

  * [solution.py](Activities/01-Ins_Anaconda_Termianl/Solved/solution.py)

* Now that Anaconda and JupyterLab are up and running, it's time to provide the students with instruction on how to navigate the file system using the terminal, as well as execute common file system commands.

* Provide a brief lecture on termianls. Explain the following:
    * What terminals are

    * What termianls are used for

    * The relationship between terminals and Windows Explorer/Mac Finder

    * Why developers use terminals over Windows Explorer/Finder

    * What terminal commands are (programs)

    * Cons of using a terminal

* Reinforce to students that the goal of the class is not to learn advanced use of terminals but to learn how to use the terminal to navigate the file system and create file system objects.

* Discuss with students the importance of downloading and installing updates prior to using a terminal. Communicate that this allows for the most recent stable versions of packages/libraries to be delivered locally for development purposes.

* Walk through the solution and demo the following:

    * How to open the Anaconda Terminal

        * Via start menu

        * Via terminal

    * How to open the Mac Finder

    * How to open the Windows Explorer

    * How to identify the version of an application

    * How to ensure the latest version of Anaconda and other packages are being used

    * How to list files in the current directory

    * How to change directories

    * How to create a directory

    * How to create an empty file

    * How to delete a file

    * How to open a text file

    * How to output file contents to the screen

    * How to write to a file

    * How to clear the terminal screen

---

### 4. Instructor Do: Review Anaconda Terminal (5 mins)

* **Files:**

  * [solution.js](Activities/02-Stu_AnacondaTerminal/Solved/solution.py)

* Open the solution and initiate a review discussion of the Anaconda terminal material. Quiz the students on the learned commands.

  * What is a terminal?

  * Why do developers use terminals?

  * What are common terminal commands?

  * How do you launch JupyterLab from the terminal?

  * How do I check the version of installed software?

* Ask the studenst about their experience completing the student activity. Inquire about their comfort level using the terminal. Ask whether or not they've developed a preference for using the terminal over  Windows Explorer/Mac Finder.

* Ask for any additional/remaining questions before moving on.

---

### X. Instructor Do: Adding files to Github (15 mins)

Show students how to submit a homework assignment in Github. Explain to students that "GitHub offers a centralized location where all developers can push and pull (upload and download) their code. This means that GitHub always holds the most up-to-date code and files, handling everyone's updates appropriately. For now, students will only need to know how to use the GUI for GitHub in order to submit homework. However, In a couple of weeks, students will learn to work with Github through the terminal using git.

Have the students follow along with the following steps:

* Visit <https://github.com> and ask students to login to their personal accounts. From the main page, create a new repository with an initialized `README.md` file. Explain that the convention in the software world is for each repository to have a "README" file that explains what the repository contains.

  ![git repo](Images/GitDemo_1.png)

* Switch back to the Desktop and create a new empty Excel file and save it. This will be used to demonstrate how to upload new files.

* Navigate back to Github website and click **Upload files**.

  ![upload file](Images/GitDemo_upload.png)

* Choose your Excel file in the dialog box; instead of the "Upload Files" button, you may also drag files from your desktop to the Github web page for a repo. Add a commit message and commit the changes.

* Finally, refresh the web page to show that the new file is now safely saved to the repository.

  ![drag file](Images/GitDemo_filedrag.gif)

Make sure that all the students have been able to follow along. Let students know that this will be how they will be submitting their homework for the first two weeks. Students will add all of the necessary files to their Github repo then submit the repository link to BCS.

Encourage students to practice Github before the next class and to use office hours if they run into any problems.

### Instructor Do: Clone and SSH debugging

* Now that we have introduced students to terminal commands, let's work on getting them set up for class.

* First, ask for a show of hands for those that have not yet finished the prework instructions for setting up their SSH keys. Although this is not the most chiefly important thing they will do today, assure them that the TA's will work with them to resolve the issues during this next activity.

* Second, walk them through the process of performing a `git clone` of the class repository. Assure them that we will cover what this "git" thing is in more detail on the next class period.

    * Go to the *class* repository and copy the HTTPS link. (Please use HTTPS as it is more likely to not be blocked by campus firewalls)
    
    * In the terminal, run a `git clone` and paste the link. While it is cloning, explain to students that cloning a repository is the process by which you copy all of the contents of a remote "folder" of sorts. The main difference is that we can constantly update this folder with new content as we progress throughout the course. If it helps, you can compare it to a cloud service like Dropbox, except we will do updates using commands in the terminal. 

    * We don't have time at the moment to cover all of the complexities of git, but we will spend more time on it on Saturday, and continue to learn about the technology over the extent of the course.

### Student Do: Clone class repository

* You will need to clone the class repository to your machine similar to the process your instructor has just demonstrated:

* Go to the class repository and copy the HTTPS link. (Please use HTTPS as it is more likely to not be blocked by campus firewalls)

* In the terminal (Git Bash for Windows), run a `git clone <paste link here>` 

* If the folder exists on your machine when the terminal command stops running; Congrats, you've successfully cloned the class repo!
