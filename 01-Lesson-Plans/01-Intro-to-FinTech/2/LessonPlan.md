### X. Instructor Do: Adding files to Github (15 mins)

Show students how to submit a homework assignment in Github. Explain to students that "GitHub offers a centralized location where all developers can push and pull (upload and download) their code. This means that GitHub always holds the most up-to-date code and files, handling everyone's updates appropriately. For now, students will only need to know how to use the GUI for GitHub in order to submit homework. However, In a couple of weeks, students will learn to work with Github through the terminal using git.

Have the students follow along with the following steps:

* Visit <https://github.com> and ask students to login to their personal accounts. From the main page, create a new repository with an initialized `README.md` file. Explain that the convention in the software world is for each repository to have a "README" file that explains what the repository contains.

* Switch back to the Desktop and create a new empty Excel file and save it. This will be used to demonstrate how to upload new files.

* Navigate back to Github website and click **Upload files**.

* Choose your Excel file in the dialog box; instead of the "Upload Files" button, you may also drag files from your desktop to the Github web page for a repo. Add a commit message and commit the changes.

* Finally, refresh the web page to show that the new file is now safely saved to the repository.

Make sure that all the students have been able to follow along. Let students know that this will be how they will be submitting their homework for the first two weeks. Students will add all of the necessary files to their Github repo then submit the repository link to BCS.

Encourage students to practice Github before the next class and to use office hours if they run into any problems.
