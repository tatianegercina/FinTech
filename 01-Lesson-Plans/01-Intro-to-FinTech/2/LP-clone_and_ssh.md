### Instructor Do: Clone and SSH debugging

* Now that we have introduced students to terminal commands, let's work on getting them set up for class.

* First, ask for a show of hands for those that have not yet finished the prework instructions for setting up their SSH keys. Although this is not the most chiefly important thing they will do today, assure them that the TA's will work with them to resolve the issues during this next activity.

* Second, walk them through the process of performing a `git clone` of the class repository. Assure them that we will cover what this "git" thing is in more detail on the next class period.
