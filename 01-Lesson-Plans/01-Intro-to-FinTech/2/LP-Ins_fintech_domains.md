### Instructor Do: Fintech Trends/Domains

* In the next few slides, we will be introducing students to some of the major domains of fintech - focusing on the main ones which we will cover in this course

* Payments

    * By far the largest segment at the moment, mobile and internet payments have been increasingly important with the rise of web companies and monbile devices.

    * In general, these technologies reduce friction of peer-to-peer payments without the need for a bank to be involved. These systems are designed to be more convienent than cash, and significantly faster than checks.

    * Payments, _especially_ credit cards, are largely built on older technologies that could be disrupted in a variety of ways in order to reduce friction and increase payment approval speeds

    * Examples: Venmo, Stripe, PayPal, Square, Apple Pay, Android Pay, Amazon Payments, Plaid, Zelle, most Cryptos

* Investment Management

    * A broad area that promises both individuals and institutions better management of wealth in addition to applications for algorithmic trading.

    * Betterment, Acorns, Robinhood, Quantlab

* Capital Investment

    * growth of alternate modes for financing larger projects

    * IndieGoGo, Kickstarter, Kiva, eREIT's


* Enterprise Solutions

    * companies need better tech for a large variety of different things

    * Equifax NeuroDecision, JPM Coin, BofA Quartz, Analytics, Fraud detection

* Insurance

    * Insurance agencies looking to cut costs can reduce the number of physical locations they have, as well as taking advantage of new data sources in order to better understand their clients

    * Area is slow to adapt new technologies due to heavy regulation, but better use of machine learning and statistics could provide pathway to higher profit margins

    * Examples: Lemondade

* Deposits

    * Similar to insurance agencies, many banks are looking for ways to cut costs while providing more/better services.
    
    * Examples: CapitalOne, Ally
    
* Many, many more! (Finance is a very broad field and technology continues to change how it looks!)

* Now that we've covered the major domains of fintech, we will next dive into currently growing trends in the across all of the fields:

* Mobile accessibility is a must: The rise of smartphones has made it a requirement that any new technology be accessible through a mobile site or app

* Use of machine learning and/or AI: With the advent of more powerful processors and cheaper memory, the applications of machine learning have enabled even faster calculations and more accurate predictions than ever berfore.  

* Fintech as a social good: A few of the big players such as Kiva and Lemonade are building companies that not only make profit, but also promote or fund nonprofits

* Banks have skin in the game: Although many would like to paint the picture that banks are completely ignorant of the rise of fintech, it couldn't be further than the truth. Many of the largest banks are internally funding a multitude of fintech projects in order to stay ahead of the curve!
