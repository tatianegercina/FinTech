    * The relationship between terminals and Windows Explorer/Mac Finder

    * Why developers use terminals over Windows Explorer/Finder

    * What terminal commands are (programs)

    * Cons of using a terminal

* Reinforce to students that the goal of the class is not to learn advanced use of terminals but to learn how to use the terminal to navigate the file system and create file system objects.

* Discuss with students the importance of downloading and installing updates prior to using a terminal. Communicate that this allows for the most recent stable versions of packages/libraries to be delivered locally for development purposes.

* Walk through the solution and demo the following:

    * How to open the Anaconda Terminal

        * Via start menu
