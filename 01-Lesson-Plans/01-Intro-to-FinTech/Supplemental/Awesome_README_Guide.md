# Writing an Awesome README File

Having a README file is crucial for any project in GitHub, GitLab, or any other version control platform. This guide is intended to help you on creating a fabulous README file for all the projects, class activities, and homework assignments that you will create in the Boot Camp as part of your public, professional portfolio.

A good README file could be the difference between getting or not your next dream job, so be conscientious while writing your README files.

## The Anatomy of a README File

There are several recommendations from industry and academia about what is the best structure for a README file; however, everyone agrees in a common rule, regardless the complexity of your project, you should always include a README file in the root folder of your repo.

In all the repositories that you create in the Boot Camp, at least, you should include the following sections in the README file.

```markdown
# Project Title

Just after the title, introduce your project by describing attractively what the project is about and what is the main problem that inspires you to create this project or what is the main contribution for the potential user of your project.

---

## Technologies

Describe what technologies are needed to use your project, such as programming languages, libraries, frameworks, and operating systems. Be sure to include the concrete versions you have used in the stable version of your project.

---

## Installation Guide

In this section, you should include detailed installation notes containing code blocks and screenshots.

---

## Examples

This section should include screenshots, code blocks, or animations showing how your project works.

---

## Usage

This section should include screenshots, code blocks, or animations explaining how to use your project.

---

## Contributors

In this section, list all the people who contribute to this project; since you may want to be reached by recruiters or potential collaborators, include your contact e-mail, and optionally your LinkedIn or Twitter profile.

---

## License

Be sure to include in this section the license that you use to distribute your project.

```

If you are creating a repository to share a report or writing document, you may want to omit the installation guide, examples, and usage sections, but not the reminder sections.

## The README Files Maturity Model

Depending on the stage of your project, or how detailed you want to go while writing a README file, the recommendations from the [README Maturity Model](https://github.com/LappleApple/feedmereadmes/blob/master/README-maturity-model.md#readme-maturity-model) may help you to boost your README files.
