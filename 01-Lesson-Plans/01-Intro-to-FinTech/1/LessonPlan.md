## 1.1 Lesson Plan - Welcome to FinTech!

---

### Overview

Today's class will focus on getting students settled down within the FinTech course as well as introducing students to the evolving financial services industry known as FinTech. In particular, instructors, teacher assistants (TAs), student success managers (SSMs), and students will introduce themselves to the class and then proceed to outlining the course agenda and requirements. Lastly, students will participate in group discussions regarding the nature of FinTech (what is it exactly?) and end the class with an overview of the unit 1 homework.

### Class Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Familiarize themselves with the academic team as well as each other.
* Outline the course format and requirements for certification.
* Map out the course topics and agenda.
* Explain exactly what FinTech is.
* Overview the unit 1 homework and corresponding requirements.

### Instructor Notes

* Today will be an easy day as the focus of the first day of the course is to simply familiarize students with each other as well as with the course itself, and ease them into the concept of FinTech and what it means. 

* This is one of the few days where there will be dedicated time for instructors to just connect with their students and get to know them. Therefore, take advantage of the time given now and set the tone! Ask your students questions and break the ice!

* Make sure your TAs are getting sufficient time to introduce themselves as well, as they will be major stakeholders when it comes to helping students progress throughout the course.

* When going over course requirements, now would also be a good time to give the ol' spiel of cheating/plagiarism. Explain that course requirements prohibit cheating or plagiarism and doing so could endanger the eligibility for certification upon graduation.

* Have your TAs keep track with the [Time Tracker](TimeTracker.xlsx).

### 1. Instructor Do: Instructor/TA Introductions (15 mins)

In this activity, students are introduced to the instructor as well the teacher assistants for their cohort/class. Instructors and teacher assistants will accompany students for the next `26` weeks, so get to know your students and vice versa!

**File:** [slideshow-placeholder]()

Take the time to talk about your (and the TAs) background(s). Feel free to talk about topics such as:

* What is your career history? Where did you start and where are you now?

* What have you accomplished in the past? What is your FinTech industry experience (if applicable)?

* What drew you to become a instructor/TA? What are you looking forward to in this course?

* What's something that defines you? What are your passions?

Ask the students if they have any further questions about yourself or the TAs. Now is the time to get to know each other so feel free to chat it up!

### 2. Instructor Do: SSM Introductions (15 mins)

In this activity, your student success manager (SSM) as well as potential university staff, program directors, student services directors, and career directors may introduce themselves.

Give your SSM and related staff their time to introduce themselves. They will probably have an agenda or introduction based on their own criteria; however, chances are they'll say something similar to the following:

* Welcome the class on their next `26` week journey.

* Emphasize the core values of the course and how TrilogyEd/2U is looking to do more than disseminate information and transfer knowledge; TrilogyEd/2U is looking to create educational *experiences*. 

* Excite students and tell them that although the next `6` months will be challenging, it will be one of their most fulfilling experiences!

* Discuss course financing and monthly payments.

### 3. Instructor Do: Class Introductions (40 mins)

At this point, it's the students' turns to introduce themselves. This is an important icebreaking activity as these will be your students for the next `26` weeks, so have fun with it!

Have every student in class introduce themselves and try to keep things lighthearted as students share their backgrounds. Some sample questions you could ask to break the ice are:

* What is your name?

* What did you study or where have you worked?

* Where are you from?

* What made you want to sign onto this course?

* What are some of your hobbies, passions?

Due to the time constraint you may not be able to ask every question for every student in the class. Therefore, pick a few that you like from the list above or think of your own relevant questions!

### 4. Instructor Do: Course Format and Requirements (20 mins)

In this activity, the instructor as well as program staff (ex. SSMs) should outline the course format and requirements for certification upon graduation.

**File:** [slideshow-placeholder]()

In the slideshow, showcase the following about the course format:

  * The course will last for the next `26` weeks, with several weeks attributed to group and final projects.

  * Class will last from `6:30 PM` to `9:30 PM` on Mondays/Wednesdays or Tuesdays/Thursdays and from `10:00 AM` to `2:00 PM` on Saturdays.

  * TA office hours are available `45` minutes before class begins and `30` minutes after class ends.

  * Class sessions will be recorded via Pantopto and can be accessed remotely anytime.

  * Students will have access to course information and perform their homework submissions via TrilogyEd/2U's BootCampSpot platform.

  * Slack will be primarily used for communicating directly with instructors and TAs or distributing activity files to students during class sessions.

Then, overview the course requirements for certification (will need to get these requirements):

  * Attendence

  * Group Projects

  * Homework

  * Loan Payments

If you finish this ahead of schedule, feel free to take one or two questions, but don't get bogged down as the course overview and requirements can be referenced anytime.

### 5. BREAK (15 mins)

### 6. Instructor Do: Course Topics/Agenda (15 mins)

In this activity, instructors will overview the topics and technologies used in the course as well the timeline for each topic or unit. 

**File:** [slideshow-placeholder]()

Continuing in the slideshow, walk through the following narrative about the course agenda and timeline:

  * We begin with an introduction to FinTech and Finance as it currently stands, discussing the current financial landscape and some of the current industry-standard methods/tools such as excel.

  * Then, we move into the direction where the industry is *going* by jumping into Python. We'll spend several weeks covering the basics of the languags and popular modern libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib before turning our sights on building predictive time series analyses. This will culminate in our first major project using what we've learned up until now to build the best portfolio strategy possible.

  * From there, we'll supercharge the financial models that we are building using everyone's favorite buzzword: Machine Learning. We'll spend about a week on the introductor material and then get into applications in financial advising, algorithmic trading, and dynamic pricing.

  * In the last major leg of the journey, we'll dive into the up and coming world of blockchain and cryptocurrencies in order to understand the advantages they provide over traditional finance in the context of transactions and third-party verification. In addition, students will learn how to develop automatically-executing smart contracts using the Solidity platform.

  * Each unit will consist of `3` lessons, which represent class sessions or days. Therefore, students will have `3` classes per week and spend `1` week per unit or topic.

### 7. Instructor Do: Intro to Fintech (15 mins)

In this activity, the instructor discusses the exact nature of what the key word *FinTech* entails.

Present to the class the following questions and answers:

  * What exactly *is* FinTech?

    * **Answer:** As the term suggests, FinTech is the combination of finance and technology. Specifically, FinTech is the technology and innovation that aims to compete with traditional financial methods and improve activities or inefficiencies in finance.

  * Why has FinTech become prevalent/important?

    * **Answer:** Traditionally the finance realm tends to be slow moving in regards to technology as they lean toward the operational mantra of "if it ain't broke don't fix it, especially when it comes to people's money". However, rapid advancements in technology have bolstered the ability for smaller companies to innovate and disrupt many traditional financial domains. Thus, larger and traditional finance firms have been forced to compete and upgrade their own technologies, thereby creating technological demand and a need for skilled technical workers.

  * What kind of careers are to be expected in FinTech?

    * **Answer:** Because FinTech is just the implementation of technology within the financial domain, FinTech careers are largely similar to that of the IT industry. It's quite common to see general data analyst, data/software engineer, and data scientist roles; however, these roles may be more specifically named as quantitative analysts/traders or portfolio analysts, for example.

### 8. Student Do: FinTech and Me (25 mins)

In this activity, students now get a chance to take some time and break off into groups of `3-4` to discuss amongst themselves what FinTech means to them.

**File:** [README.md](01-Stu_FinTech_Group_Discussions/README.md)

### 9. Instructor Do: Review FinTech and Me (10 mins)

* Give each group `2-3` minutes to orally present their findings.

* Once all groups have presented, tie everything back together by explaining that FinTech is the implementation of technology to the finance industry, but what it *means* to each individual person can differ. Some see FinTech as a way to upgrade their current skills and be more employer marketable; some see FinTech as a way to solve the inefficiencies in their current finance role; some see FinTech as a path to embarking on a new career supported by growing demand. 

* Despite students' differing reasons for wanting to learn more about FinTech, every student has made the leap to take this course. Therefore, encourage students to continue to get to know each other as they'll be "together in the trenches" for the next `26` weeks and could serve as valuable network connections after the completion of the course.

### 10. Instructor Do: Introduce Homework (10 mins)

In this activity, the instructor will go over the unit `1` homework and define its requirements.

Before heading out for the night, introduce the unit `1` homework assignment in which students will have to develop a case study around a particular FinTech company or technology. Students should look to answer as many of the following questions as they can:

* Company Sector:
  
  * Which financial industry it is in?

  * Trends and competitors in this industry; 

* Company Business Activities:
  
  * What “problem” does this company solve?
  
  * Who is their intended customer?
  
  * What solution does this company offer that their competitor does not or cannot? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
  
  * Which technologies are they currently using and how are they implementing them?
  
  * What are they doing right? What could be improved? 
  
* Recommendations:
  
  * If you were to advise them – what products or services would you suggest they add to their  services (whether another company already has  them or something that is your pure imagination)?
  
  * Why do you think it would benefit them? 
  
  * What technologies would your proposed ideas incorporate? Why are those technologies  appropriate for your solution?

Ask the students if they have any remaining questions before ending the class.
