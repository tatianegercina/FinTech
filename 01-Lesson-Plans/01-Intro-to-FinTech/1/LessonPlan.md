## 1.1 Lesson Plan: Welcome to FinTech!

---

### Overview

Today's class will focus on familiarizing students with this course as well as introducing them to the evolving financial services industry known as FinTech. The instructor, teacher assistants (TAs), student success managers (SSMs), and students will all have an opportunity to introduce themselves to the class. Following an overview of the course agenda and requirements, students will participate in group discussions about FinTech. The class will end with a review of the Unit 1 homework assignment.

### Class Objectives

By the end of class, students will:

* Get to know the instructional team as well as each other.

* Become familiar with the course format and requirements for certification.

* Review the course topics and agenda.

* Be able to explain what FinTech is.

* Review the completion and submission guidelines for the Unit 1 homework assignment.

### Instructor Notes

* Today will be more relaxed, as the focus of the first day of the course is to simply familiarize students with each other as well as with the course itself, and ease them into the concept of FinTech.

* This is one of the few days where there will be dedicated time for instructors to connect with the students and get to know them. Take advantage of this time and use it to set the tone! Ask your students questions and break the ice.

* Make sure your TAs have sufficient time to introduce themselves as well, as they will be major stakeholders when it comes to helping students progress through the course.

* When reviewing the course requirements, be sure to emphasize that cheating or plagiarism of any kind is prohibited; engaging in this kind of behaviour can endanger student eligibility for certification upon graduation.

* Let students know a student guide for each unit can be found in the corresponding unit's supplemental folder. Each guide has helpful links and FAQ's for the unit. The unit 1 student guide can be found [here.](../Supplemental/StudentGuide.md) If you have any recommendations for additional questions, feel free to log an issue or a pull request with your desired additions.

### 1. Instructor Do: Introductions (40 min)

This first part of the lesson will be led by the student success manager (SSM). They will discuss attendance and graduation requirements, as well as share opportunities for students to get support.

During this time, everyone associated with the course will introduce themselves to break the ice and get to know each other. This includes SSMs, university staff, program directors, career directors, the instructional staff (instructors and TAs), and the students.

Feel free to answer the questions below as a way to introduce yourself. However, be sure to keep your introduction brief, as there is a great deal to cover in this first class.

* What is your career history? Where did you start and where are you now?

* What have you accomplished thus far in your career? What is your FinTech industry experience (if applicable)?

* What made you want to become an instructor or TA? What are you looking forward to in this course?

* What is something that defines you? What are your passions?

### 2. Instructor Do: Defining FinTech (20 min)

In this section, you will discuss the concept of FinTech as well as provide some information about the FinTech industry.

Open the slideshow and review today's objectives.

Then move on to the first topic of the day: defining FinTech. Review the slides while presenting the following questions and answers to the class.

* What exactly *is* FinTech?

  **Answer:** Generally, as the term suggests, FinTech is the combination of finance and technology. More specifically, FinTech refers to the financial services industry that has been disrupted by technological innovation, and that aims to compete with traditional financial methods in order to improve activities and inefficiencies in finance.

* What defines a FinTech company?

  **Answer:** A FinTech company is a financial services company that seeks to utilize technology to drive more efficient operation, either through back-end network infrastructure or consumer engagement. Market analysis more broadly categorizes FinTech companies as falling in one of the following groups:

  * Infrastructure providers

  * Large technology ecosystems

  * New entrants/start-ups

  * Incumbent financial institutions

* Why has FinTech become so important?

  **Answer:** Rapid advancements in technology have bolstered the ability for smaller companies to innovate and disrupt many traditional financial domains. Thus, larger and traditional finance firms have been forced to compete and upgrade their own technologies, thereby creating technological demand and a need for skilled technical workers.

* What kind of careers are to be expected in FinTech?

  **Answer:** Because FinTech is just the implementation of technology within the financial domain, FinTech careers are largely similar to that of the IT industry. It's quite common to see general data analyst, data/software engineer, and data scientist roles. However, these roles may be more specifically named as quantitative analysts/traders or portfolio analysts, for example.

### 3. Student Do: FinTech and Me (5 min)

In this activity, students get a chance to reflect by writing down what FinTech means to them.

**File:** [README.md](Activities/01-Stu_FinTech_Group_Discussions/README.md)

During this activity, students will share their responses with their classmates. Be sure that you and the TAs circulate the classroom to listen to students' responses. If you hear responses that are especially engaging or interesting, ask those students to share their responses with the class during the review portion (Instructor Do: Review FinTech and Me).

### 4. Instructor Do: Review FinTech and Me (10 min)

**Optional:** Consider using a tool such as [polleverywhere](https://www.polleverywhere.com/) to collect and share responses in real-time. [Groupmap](https://www.groupmap.com/) may also be a good option.

Review each question. Ask for a few volunteers for each of the response questions. Encourage students who had interesting responses in the previous activity to share.

Once all volunteers have presented, tie everything together by explaining the following:

* FinTech is the application of technology to the finance industry, but what it means at the individual level can differ.

* Some see FinTech as a way to upgrade their current skills to be more marketable to employers, while others see it as a way to eliminate inefficiencies in their current finance role. Furthermore, still, others see FinTech as a path to a new career supported by growing demand.

Despite students' differing reasons for wanting to learn more about FinTech, each of them has made the leap to take this course. Therefore, it's important to continue to get to know each other, as they'll be together "in the trenches" for the next 24 weeks. The relationships you build in this class can serve as valuable network connections after the completion of the course.

Answer any questions before moving on.

### 6. Instructor Do: Tips (10 min)

Provide students with some encouragement and tips for overcoming the mental frustrations they will more than likely face throughout the course.

Open the lesson slides, move to the "Tips" section and emphasize the following points.

* Embrace your inner toddler. Recognizing how little you know is the first step toward growth as a learner. Hard work, humility, and a relentless desire to improve are essential for succeeding in this program.

* At times, learning the skills taught in this course will be intimidating and frustrating. Remember that becoming a skilled professional is challenging and will take time. There is no way around that.

* Due to the challenging nature of this course, there will be many moments where you will doubt yourselves. Remember that everyone starts as a beginner, including the instructor. Also, remember why you were admitted to this program in the first place: you have what it takes to succeed.

* Form a community with your classmates. Even though challenging times are up ahead, as students, you have a reliable support system: the instructor, TAs, student success manager, and, perhaps most importantly, each other. When you're frustrated or stuck, remember that we're all in this together. Seek help when you need it and lift each other up.

* Lastly, learning is supposed to be frustrating! It's a process, so stick with it. Things only get easier when we choose to embrace the difficulty and put in the hours to succeed.

* Most importantly, celebrate your successes!

### 9. Student Do: Rip Van Winkle Thought Exercise (10 min)

In this activity, students will reflect on how the current state of the FinTech world may differ from that of someone from the year 1999.

Quickly explain to the class the following:

* *Rip Van Winkle* is a short story by the American author Washington Irving, first published in 1819. It follows a Dutch American villager in colonial America named Rip Van Winkle, who falls asleep in the Catskill Mountains and wakes up 20 years later, completely missing the events of the American Revolution.

* We'll apply the Rip Van Winkle story to FinTech by imagining if a financial analyst who fell asleep in the year 1999 and woke up today. What would he or she find most surprising about the current finance world?

* You should define areas of finance that have been deeply affected by technology, naming specific companies, products, or innovations that would be surprising to a financial analyst from 1999.

* You should form groups of three or four. Each group will present their thoughts during the review portion of this activity.

Answer any questions before moving on.

---

### 10. Instructor Do: Review Rip Van Winkle Thought Exercise (5 min)

In this review portion of the previous activity, students will present their reflections based on the Rip Van Winkle thought experiment.

* Ask for a few volunteers to share their group's thoughts on what they felt would be most surprising to a financial analyst from 1999 witnessing the current state of the finance world.

* Take note of each group's findings and emphasize some of the overarching themes regarding the state of the current FinTech ecosystem. Some topics that are likely to come up include:

  * Automation

  * Big data

  * Mobile infrastructure

  * Cloud infrastructure

Answer any questions before moving on.

### 11. Instructor Do: The Rise of FinTech (10 min)

In this section, engage students with a facilitated discussion about why FinTech has become so prevalent today.

Open the lesson slides deck, move to "The Rise of FinTech" section and use the slides to help guide your discussion, focusing on the following talking points.

As you review the slides, look for opportunities to prompt students to reflect. Use the Socratic method to encourage students to offer their opinions aloud before revealing your own answer. For example, ask students to share examples of innovative FinTech companies and how they are disrupting the financial services industry.

* Market analysis shows that global FinTech investment has grown dramatically in recent years.

* Since 2015, FinTech startups are disrupting in different sectors in Canada, such as: accounting and expenses management, capital markets, lending, personal finance, digital banking, insurance, real estate, among others.

* Recent technological advancements in (big) data and mobile network infrastructure has led to a consumer desire for companies to provide not only more efficient data-driven services, but also quality engagement through scalable mobile platforms.

* To keep up with consumer demand, large financial firms that have been slower to adopt newer technologies have been forced to make larger investments in technology.

* As a result, there is a growing demand for technical specialists who have the background and experience to navigate financial waters.

### 12. Student Do: Alpacalypse Now (15 min)

In this activity, students will once again break off into groups of two to four to define and articulate the challenges faced by the fictional Altruistic Alpacas charity. They will need to list at least five financial or technical challenges associated with each of the five core problem areas defined by the client.

**Notes:**

* Open the lesson slides and move to the "FinTech Thought Experiments" section to set up this activity.

* The [instructor preparation document](../Instructional_Support/Blockchain.md) contains additional background information for the blockchain related slides.

* In essence, this thought experiment asks students to define the financial and technical challenges of the Altruistic Alpacas charity. Students may have a mix of financial and technical backgrounds, but this exercise should force them to think creatively about the problem and identify challenges from both a financial and technical perspective.

* To succeed in this exercise in the classroom, ensure that students are thinking outside their sphere of knowledge.

* Challenge students to think deeply about each problem.

* Set a timer for 15 minutes and allow students to discuss their options. Remind them that they should be prepared to discuss these issues with the class.

* As students work, you and your TAs should walk around the classroom and listen to student discussions. When appropriate, nudge them to think more critically. Many students may rely on their backgrounds, but this is an excellent time to think outside the box. For instance:

  * If students seem to have focused on only the financial aspects of the problem, prod them to think about the technical challenges. Or maybe they have taken an analytical approach; if so, ask about a machine learning/AI approach. You can also ask if they considered a cryptocurrency or blockchain solution, and so on.

  * If students seem to have a full list of financial and technical challenges, ask them about regulatory or security issues that they may face. Prompt them to also think about governance and cross-border issues that may come up with an international charity.

---

### 13. Instructor Do: Review Alpacalypse Now (15 min)

When time is up, ask a few groups to share some of the challenges they identified. Consider opening a notepad file or using the whiteboard to track a running list of the challenges for each problem area.

Once you have a list of challenges, open the lesson slides and navigate to the "Review Alpacalypse Now" section to break down some of the potential solutions to these problems.

Tell students the following:

* The slides do not represent a comprehensive list of solutions, but they should provide some ideas about how FinTech can be used to address various challenges.

* The slides provide example solutions to each core problem identified by the client (Altruistic Alpacas). While some solutions are more concrete than others, try not to get bogged down with the details. The slides are meant to provide food for thought.

When appropriate, ask students to share examples. You should also share any relevant stories from your own experience.

Wrap up the activity review by reminding students that while these solutions may not have completely addressed all of the challenges identified, they show the promise of FinTech solutions for complex problems like these.

Encourage students by reminding them that they will soon get to dig into these technologies in future classes!

Answer any questions before moving on.

### 14. Instructor Do: Introduce Homework (10 min)

In this activity, you will review the Unit 1 homework assignment with the class.

**File:** [Homework instructions](../../../02-Homework/01-FinTech/Instructions/README.md)

Open the homework instructions and briefly discuss the task and due date.

**Note:** As a general rule, all homework is due one week after the last day of the unit is covered.

Briefly talk through the process of submitting homework and let students know they will be covering everything they need to know for this assignment in the next two classes.

Answer any questions, and thank students for their time and a great first class!
