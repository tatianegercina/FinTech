## 1.1 Lesson Plan: Welcome to FinTech!

---

### Overview

Today's class will focus on familiarizing students with this course as well as introducing them to the evolving financial services industry known as FinTech. The instructor, teacher assistants (TAs), student success managers (SSMs), and students will all have an opportunity to introduce themselves to the class. Following an overview of the course agenda and requirements, students will participate in group discussions regarding the nature of FinTech (what is it?). The class will end with a review of the Unit 1 homework assignment.

### Class Objectives

By the end of class, students will:

* Get to know the instructional team as well as each other.

* Become familiar with the course format and requirements for certification.

* Review the course topics and agenda.

* Be able to explain what FinTech is.

* Review the completion and submission guidelines for the Unit 1 homework assignment.

### Instructor Notes

* Today will be more relaxed, as the focus of the first day of the course is to simply familiarize students with each other as well as with the course itself, and ease them into the concept of FinTech.

* This is one of the few days where there will be dedicated time for instructors to connect with the students and get to know them. Take advantage of this time and use it to set the tone! Ask your students questions and break the ice.

* Make sure your TAs have sufficient time to introduce themselves as well, as they will be major stakeholders when it comes to helping students progress through the course.

* When reviewing the course requirements, be sure to emphasize that cheating or plagiarism of any kind is prohibited; engaging in any kind of plagiarism can endanger student eligibility for certification upon graduation.

### 1. Instructor Do: Introductions (40 min)

This activity will be led by the SSM. They will discuss student attendance, graduation requirements, and share opportunities to get support.

During this activity, every team member associated with this course will introduce themselves to break the ice and get to know each other. This includes Student Success Managers (SSMs), university staff, program directors, Career Directors, individual students, and Instructional Staff.

As you introduce yourself, feel free to include the topics below. However, be sure to keep your introduction brief, as there is a great deal to cover in this first class.

* What is your career history? Where did you start and where are you now?

* What have you accomplished in the past? What is your FinTech industry experience (if applicable)?

* What drew you to become a instructor/TA? What are you looking forward to in this course?

* What is something that defines you? What are your passions?

### 2. Instructor Do: Defining FinTech (20 min)

In this section, you will discuss the concept of FinTech as well as provide some information about the industry.

Present to the class the following questions and answers:

* What exactly *is* FinTech?

  **Answer:** Generally, as the term suggests, FinTech is the combination of finance and technology. More specifically, however, FinTech refers to the financial services industry that has been disrupted by technological innovation that aims to compete with traditional financial methods and improve activities or inefficiencies in finance.

* What defines a FinTech company?

  **Answer:** A FinTech company is a financial services company that seeks to utilize technology to drive more efficient operation, either through back-end network infrastructure or consumer engagement. Market analysis more broadly categorizes FinTech companies as falling in one of the following groups:

    * Infrastructure providers

    * Large technology ecosystems

    * New entrants/start-ups

    * Incumbent financial institutions

* Why has FinTech become so important?

  **Answer:** Rapid advancements in technology have bolstered the ability for smaller companies to innovate and disrupt many traditional financial domains. Thus, larger and traditional finance firms have been forced to compete and upgrade their own technologies, thereby creating technological demand and a need for skilled technical workers.

* What kind of careers are to be expected in FinTech?

  **Answer:** Because FinTech is just the implementation of technology within the financial domain, FinTech careers are largely similar to that of the IT industry. It's quite common to see general data analyst, data/software engineer, and data scientist roles. However, these roles may be more specifically named as quantitative analysts/traders or portfolio analysts, for example.

### 3. Instructor Do: Course Overview (10 min)

In this section, provide an overview of the topics and technologies used in the course, as well the timeline for each topic or unit.

**File:** [slideshow-placeholder]()

Use the slideshow to go over the course agenda and timeline:

* **Weeks 1–2:** Students are introduced to the world of FinTech and the current financial landscape. Then they will dive into the financial modeling methods of the current industry-standard tool, Microsoft Excel.

* **Weeks 3–7:** While useful and easy to grasp, Excel is limited in its technical capabilities compared to a full-fledged progamming language like Python. Therefore, over the next several weeks, students will cover the basics of Python as well as how to use additional libraries and tools such as Pandas, APIs, Plotly, and SQL databases, within the context of financial analysis.

* **Weeks 8–9** Students are tasked with their first project.

* **Weeks 10–15:** Companies are becoming more and more data-driven in their decision making. Therefore, through machine learning, students will learn how to interpret and create financial models as well as automate the execution of such models. Topics include algorithmic trading, robo-advisory, time series analysis, risk management, and Cloud ML technologies.

* **Weeks 16–17:** Students are tasked with their second project.

* **Weeks 18–22:** With its benefits of security, speed, and decentralized peer-to-peer validation, blockchain technology has already become more efficient than tradtional finance in the context of transactions and third-party validation. Thus, students will learn about blockchain fundamentals, smart contracts using Solidity, and how to develop blockchain applications on the popular Ethereum blockchain network.

* **Weeks 23–24:** Students are tasked with their final project.

### 4. Instructor Do: Tips (10 min)

Provide students with some encouragement and tips for overcoming the mental frustrations they will more than likely face throughout the course.

**File:** [slideshow-placeholder]()

Open the next series of slides and emphasize the following points:

* Hard work, humility, and a relentless desire to improve are essential for succeeding in this program. Recognizing how little you know is a first step toward growth as a learner.

* At times, learning the skills taught in this course will be intimidating and frustrating. Remember that becoming a skilled professional is challenging and will take time. There is no way around that.

* Due to the challenging nature of this course, there will be many moments where students will doubt themselves. Remember that everyone starts as a beginner, including the instructor. Also remember why you were admitted to this program in the first place: you have what it takes to succeed.

* Even though challenging times are up ahead, students have a solid support system: their instructor, TAs, student success manager, and,perhaps most importantly, each other. When you're frustrated or stuck, remember that we're all in this together. Seek help when you need it and lift each other up.

* Lastly, learning is supposed to be frustrating! It's a process, so stick with it. Things only get easier when we choose to embrace the difficulty.

### 6. Instructor Do: The Rise of FinTech (10 min)

In this section, engage students with a facilitated discussion about why FinTech has become so prevalent today.

**File:** [slideshow-placeholder]()

Use the slides to help guide your discussion, pointing out the following:

* Recent technological advancements in (big) data and mobile network infrastructure has led to a consumer desire for companies to not only provide more efficent data-driven services, but also quality engagement through scalable mobile platforms.

* To keep up with consumer demand, large financial firms that have been slower to adopt newer technologies have been forced to make larger investments in technology.

* Market analysis shows that global FinTech investment has grown dramatically in recent years.

* As a result, there is a growing demand for technical specialists who have the background and experience to navigate financial waters.

As you review the slides, look for opportunities to prompt students to reflect. Use the Socratic method to encourage students to offer their opinions aloud before revealing your own answer.

For example, ask students to share examples of innovative FinTech companies and how they are disrupting the financial services industry.

### 7. Student Do: FinTech and Me (5 min)

In this activity, students get a chance to reflect by writing down what FinTech means to them.

**File:** [README.md](Activities/01-Stu_FinTech_Group_Discussions/README.md)

During this activity, students will share their responses with their classmates. Be sure that you and the TAs circulate the classroom to listen to students' responses. If you hear responses that are especially engaging or interesting, ask those students to share their response with the class during the review portion (Instructor Do: Review FinTech and Me).

---

### 8. Instructor Do: Review FinTech and Me (10 min)

**Optional:** Consider using a tool such as [polleverywhere](https://www.polleverywhere.com/) to collect and share responses in real-time. [Groupmap](https://www.groupmap.com/) may also be a good option.

Review each question. Ask for a few volunteers for each of the response questions. Encourage students who had interesting responses in the previous activity to share.

Once all volunteers have presented, tie everything together by explaining the following:

* FinTech is the application of technology to the finance industry, but what it means at the individual level can differ.

* Some see FinTech as a way to upgrade their current skills to be more marketable to employers, while others see it as a way to eliminate inefficiencies in their current finance role. And still others see FinTech as a path to new career supported by growing demand.

* Despite students' differing reasons for wanting to learn more about FinTech, each of them has made the leap to take this course. Therefore, it's important to continue to get to know each other, as they'll be together "in the trenches" for the next 26 weeks. The relationships you build in this class can serve as valuable network connections after the completion of the course.

### 9. Student Do: Thought Experiment (25 mins)

In this activity, students will once again break off into groups of `2-4` to define and articulate the challenges faced by the Altruistic Alpacas charity. They will need to list at least 5 financial or technical challenges associated with each of the 5 core problem areas defined by the client.

**Files:**

* [Thought Experiment Slides]()

Use the slides to setup the first thought experiment.

* In essence, this experiment has students attempting to define the financial and technical challenges that the charity is facing. Students may have a mix of financial and technical backgrounds, but this exercise should force them to think creatively about the problem and identify challenges from both the financial and technical perspective.

* The key to executing this exercise in the classroom is in ensuring that students are engaged to think outside of their sphere of knowledge and to think deeply about each problem.

Set a time for 25 minutes and allow students to dicuss their options. Remind them that they should be prepared to discuss these issues with the class afterwards.

As students are working on this challenge, you and your TAs should walk around and listen to student conversations. When appropriate, nudge them to think more critically. For instance:

* If students seem to have focused on only the financial aspects of the problem, prod them to think about the technical challenges and vice versa. Many students may rely on their personal backgrounds, but this is a good time to think outside the box. Have they considered only an analytical approach? If so, ask about a machine learning/AI approach. Have they considered a cryptocurrency or blockchain solution?

* If students seem to have a full list of financial and technical challenges, ask them about regulatory or security issues that they may face. Prompt them to also think about governance and cross-border issues with an international charity.

### 10. Instructor Do: Review Thought Experiment  (25 mins)

**File:** [slideshow-placeholder]()

After time is up, ask a few student groups to share some of their identified challenges. Consider opening a notepad file or using the whiteboard to track a running list of the challenges for each problem area.

Once you've gotten a large enough list, switch to teh slides where it breaks down some of the potential solutions to solving these problems and overcoming these challenges. Be candid that the solution may not be comprehensive, but it should give them some ideas about how FinTech can be used on various fronts to address the problems.

* The slides provide example solutions to each core problem that the client identified. While some are more concrete than others, try not to get bogged down into the details. These slides are meant to provide students fodder for thought.

* When appropriate in the slides, ask students for examples.

* If you have stories relevant to the slides from your personal experience, feel extra encouraged to share!

Wrap up the activity by reminding students that while these solutions may not have completely addressed all of the challenges identified, they show the promise of FinTech solutions on complex problems like these.

Encourage students by reminding them that they will soon get to dig into these technologies in-depth during future classes!

### 11. Instructor Do: Introduce Homework (10 min)

In this activity, instructors will review the Unit 1 homework assignment with the class.

Open the [homework instructions](../../../02-Homework/01-FinTech/Instructions/README.md) and briefly discuss the task and due date.

  **Note:** As a general rule, all homework is due one week after the last day of the unit is covered.

Briefly talk through the process of submitting homework and let students know they will be covering everything they need to know for this assignment in the next two classes.

Answer any questions, and thank students for their time and a great first class!
