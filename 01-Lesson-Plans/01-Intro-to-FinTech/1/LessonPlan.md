## 1.1 Lesson Plan: Welcome to FinTech!

---

### Overview

Today's class will focus on familiarizing students with this course as well as introducing them to the evolving financial services industry known as FinTech. The instructor, teacher assistants (TAs), student success managers (SSMs), and students will all have an opportunity to introduce themselves to the class. Following an overview of the course agenda and requirements, students will participate in group discussions regarding the nature of FinTech (what is it?). The class will end with a review of the Unit 1 homework assignment.

### Class Objectives

By the end of class, students will:

* Get to know the instructional team as well as each other.

* Become familiar with the course format and requirements for certification.

* Review the course topics and agenda.

* Be able to explain what FinTech is.

* Review the completion and submission guidelines for the Unit 1 homework assignment.

### Instructor Notes

* Today will be more relaxed, as the focus of the first day of the course is to simply familiarize students with each other as well as with the course itself, and ease them into the concept of FinTech.

* This is one of the few days where there will be dedicated time for instructors to connect with the students and get to know them. Take advantage of this time and use it to set the tone! Ask your students questions and break the ice.

* Make sure your TAs have sufficient time to introduce themselves as well, as they will be major stakeholders when it comes to helping students progress through the course.

* When reviewing the course requirements, be sure to emphasize that cheating or plagiarism of any kind is prohibited; engaging in any kind of plagiarism can endanger student eligibility for certification upon graduation.

### 1. Instructor Do: Introductions (40 min)

In this first part of the lesson, everyone associated with this FinTech course will introduce themselves to the class. This includes the student success managers (SSMs), instructor, and teacher assistants (TAs), as well as university staff, program directors, student services directors, and career directors. Students will also have an opportunity to introduce themselves. The goal here is to break the ice and get the class acquainted with the staff and each other.

* The first 40 minutes of class consists of introductions from the following:

  * Student success managers (SSMs), along with (potentially) university staff, program directors, student services director, and career directors

  * Individual students

  * Teacher assistants (TAs)

  * Instructors

* The SSM, university staff, and career services team will most likely present their own introductions based on their respective department criteria.

As you and the TAs introduce yourself, feel free to include the topics below. However, be sure to keep your introduction brief, as there is a great deal to cover in this first class.

* What is your career history? Where did you start and where are you now?

* What have you accomplished in the past? What is your FinTech industry experience (if applicable)?

* What drew you to become a instructor/TA? What are you looking forward to in this course?

* What is something that defines you? What are your passions?

### 2. Instructor Do: Defining FinTech (20 min)

In this section, you will discuss the concept of FinTech as well as provide some information about the industry.

Present to the class the following questions and answers:

* What exactly *is* FinTech?

  **Answer:** Generally, as the term suggests, FinTech is the combination of finance and technology. More specifically, however, FinTech refers to the financial services industry that has been disrupted by technological innovation that aims to compete with traditional financial methods and improve activities or inefficiencies in finance.

* What defines a FinTech company?

  **Answer:** A FinTech company is a financial services company that seeks to utilize technology to drive more efficient operation, either through back-end network infrastructure or consumer engagement. Market analysis more broadly categorizes FinTech companies as falling in one of the following groups:

    * Infrastructure providers

    * Large technology ecosystems

    * New entrants/start-ups

    * Incumbent financial institutions

* Why has FinTech become so important?

  **Answer:** Rapid advancements in technology have bolstered the ability for smaller companies to innovate and disrupt many traditional financial domains. Thus, larger and traditional finance firms have been forced to compete and upgrade their own technologies, thereby creating technological demand and a need for skilled technical workers.

* What kind of careers are to be expected in FinTech?

  **Answer:** Because FinTech is just the implementation of technology within the financial domain, FinTech careers are largely similar to that of the IT industry. It's quite common to see general data analyst, data/software engineer, and data scientist roles. However, these roles may be more specifically named as quantitative analysts/traders or portfolio analysts, for example.

### 3. Instructor Do: Course Overview (10 min)

In this section, provide an overview of the topics and technologies used in the course, as well the timeline for each topic or unit.

**File:** [slideshow-placeholder]()

Use the slideshow to go over the course agenda and timeline:

* **Weeks 1–2:** Students are introduced to the world of FinTech and the current financial landscape. Then they will dive into the financial modeling methods of the current industry-standard tool, Microsoft Excel.

* **Weeks 3–7:** While useful and easy to grasp, Excel is limited in its technical capabilities compared to a full-fledged progamming language like Python. Therefore, over the next several weeks, students will cover the basics of Python as well as how to use additional libraries and tools such as Pandas, APIs, Plotly, and SQL databases, within the context of financial analysis.

* **Weeks 8–9** Students are tasked with their first project.

* **Weeks 10–15:** Companies are becoming more and more data-driven in their decision making. Therefore, through machine learning, students will learn how to interpret and create financial models as well as automate the execution of such models. Topics include algorithmic trading, robo-advisory, time series analysis, risk management, and Cloud ML technologies.

* **Weeks 16–17:** Students are tasked with their second project.

* **Weeks 18–22:** With its benefits of security, speed, and decentralized peer-to-peer validation, blockchain technology has already become more efficient than tradtional finance in the context of transactions and third-party validation. Thus, students will learn about blockchain fundamentals, smart contracts using Solidity, and how to develop blockchain applications on the popular Ethereum blockchain network.

* **Weeks 23–24:** Students are tasked with their final project.

### 4. Instructor Do: Tips (10 min)

Provide students with some encouragement and tips for overcoming the mental frustrations they will more than likely face throughout the course.

**File:** [slideshow-placeholder]()

Open the next series of slides and emphasize the following points:

* Hard work, humility, and a relentless desire to improve are essential for succeeding in this program. Recognizing how little you know is a first step toward growth as a learner.

* At times, learning the skills taught in this course will be intimidating and frustrating. Remember that becoming a skilled professional is challenging and will take time. There is no way around that.

* Due to the challenging nature of this course, there will be many moments where students will doubt themselves. Remember that everyone starts as a beginner, including the instructor. Also remember why you were admitted to this program in the first place: you have what it takes to succeed.

* Even though challenging times are up ahead, students have a solid support system: their instructor, TAs, student success manager, and,perhaps most importantly, each other. When you're frustrated or stuck, remember that we're all in this together. Seek help when you need it and lift each other up.

* Lastly, learning is supposed to be frustrating! It's a process, so stick with it. Things only get easier when we choose to embrace the difficulty.

### 6. Instructor Do: The Rise of FinTech (10 min)

In this section, engage students with a facilitated discussion about why FinTech has become so prevalent today.

**File:** [slideshow-placeholder]()

Use the slides to help guide your discussion, pointing out the following:

* Recent technological advancements in (big) data and mobile network infrastructure has led to a consumer desire for companies to not only provide more efficent data-driven services, but also quality engagement through scalable mobile platforms.

* To keep up with consumer demand, large financial firms that have been slower to adopt newer technologies have been forced to make larger investments in technology.

* Market analysis shows that global FinTech investment has grown dramatically in recent years.

* As a result, there is a growing demand for technical specialists who have the background and experience to navigate financial waters.

As you review the slides, look for opportunities to prompt students to reflect. Use the Socratic method to encourage students to offer their opinions aloud before revealing your own answer.

For example, ask students to share examples of innovative FinTech companies and how they are disrupting the financial services industry.

### 7. Student Do: FinTech and Me (5 min)

In this activity, students get a chance to reflect by writing down what FinTech means to them.

**File:** [README.md](Activities/01-Stu_FinTech_Group_Discussions/README.md)

During this activity, students will share their responses with their classmates. Be sure that you and the TAs circulate the classroom to listen to students' responses. If you hear responses that are especially engaging or interesting, ask those students to share their response with the class during the review portion (Instructor Do: Review FinTech and Me).

---

### 8. Instructor Do: Review FinTech and Me (10 min)

**Optional:** Consider using a tool such as [polleverywhere](https://www.polleverywhere.com/) to collect and share responses in real-time. [Groupmap](https://www.groupmap.com/) may also be a good option.

Review each question. Ask for a few volunteers for each of the response questions. Encourage students who had interesting responses in the previous activity to share.

Once all volunteers have presented, tie everything together by explaining the following:

* FinTech is the application of technology to the finance industry, but what it means at the individual level can differ.

* Some see FinTech as a way to upgrade their current skills to be more marketable to employers, while others see it as a way to eliminate inefficiencies in their current finance role. And still others see FinTech as a path to new career supported by growing demand.

* Despite students' differing reasons for wanting to learn more about FinTech, each of them has made the leap to take this course. Therefore, it's important to continue to get to know each other, as they'll be together "in the trenches" for the next 26 weeks. The relationships you build in this class can serve as valuable network connections after the completion of the course.

### 9. Student Do: Lending Thought Experiment (30 min)

In this activity, students will break into groups of 2 to 4 to devise a solution to the traditional borrowing/lending finance problem that FinTech has come to solve. This group thought experiment should get students thinking about how technology has been applied to bolster the financial services industry.

**File:** [README.md](Activities/02-Stu_FinTech_Thought_Experiment/README.md)

---

### 10. Instructor Do: Review Lending Thought Experiment  (20 min)

**File:** [slideshow-placeholder]()

* Give each group 3 or 4 minutes (adjust based on the class size and remaining time) to briefly explain their solution and how it solves the traditional lending problem.

* After each group has presented their findings, open the slideshow and go over the following:

  * The traditional lending space has become disrupted with the advent of peer-to-peer lending.

  * As the name suggests, peer-to-peer lending involves connecting borrowers and lenders from a marketplace of individuals rather than between an individual and a financial institution.

  * Peer-to-peer lending invokes lower loan interest rates because there is a greater selection––and,therefore,competition––among potential borrowers and lenders.

  * Because there is a greater selection of potential borrowers and lenders in peer-to-peer lending, there is also higher degree of tolerance when it comes to loan eligibility requirements. Financial institutions may need to abide by minimum loan eligibility requirements; a personal investor or lender, on the other hand, does not.

  * LendingClub is a prime example of peer-to-peer lending. LendingClub is the world's leading online marketplace for connecting borrowers and investors. Their mission is to transform the banking industry to make it more transparent, efficient, and customer-friendly.

Ask if there are any questions before moving on.

### 11. Instructor Do: Introduce Homework (10 min)

In this part of the lesson, review the Unit 1 homework assignment.

In the Unit 1 homework assignment, students will develop a case study based on a particular FinTech company or technology. Students should answer as many of the following questions as they can:

**Company Sector**

  * Which financial industry is the company part of?

  * What are some trends and competitors in this industry?

**Company Business Activities**

  * What “problem” does this company solve?

  * Who is the intended customer?

  * What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

  * Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?

  * What is the company doing right? What could be improved?

**Recommendations**

  * If you were an advisor for the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?

  * Why do you think this product or service would benefit the business?

  * What technologies would your proposed ideas incorporate? Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

Ask if there are any questions before ending class.
