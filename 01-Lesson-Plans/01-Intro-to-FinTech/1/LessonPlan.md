## 1.1 Lesson Plan - Welcome to FinTech!

---

### Overview

Today's class will focus on getting students settled down within the FinTech course as well as introducing students to the evolving financial services industry known as FinTech. In particular, instructors, teacher assistants (TAs), student success managers (SSMs), and students will introduce themselves to the class and then proceed to outlining the course agenda and requirements. Lastly, students will participate in group discussions regarding the nature of FinTech (what is it exactly?) and end the class with an overview of the unit 1 homework.

### Class Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Familiarize themselves with the academic team as well as each other.
* Outline the course format and requirements for certification.
* Map out the course topics and agenda.
* Explain exactly what FinTech is.
* Overview the unit 1 homework and corresponding requirements.

### Instructor Notes

* Today will be an easy day as the focus of the first day of the course is to simply familiarize students with each other as well as with the course itself, and ease them into the concept of FinTech and what it means. 

* This is one of the few days where there will be dedicated time for instructors to just connect with their students and get to know them. Therefore, take advantage of the time given now and set the tone! Ask your students questions and break the ice!

* Make sure your TAs are getting sufficient time to introduce themselves as well, as they will be major stakeholders when it comes to helping students progress throughout the course.

* When going over course requirements, now would also be a good time to give the ol' spiel of cheating/plagiarism. Explain that course requirements prohibit cheating or plagiarism and doing so could endanger the eligibility for certification upon graduation.

* Have your TAs keep track with the [Time Tracker](TimeTracker.xlsx).

### 1. Instructor Do: Introductions (40 mins)

In this activity, every member associated with the current FinTech course will introduce themselves to break the ice and get to know each other. This includes student success managers (SSMs), university staff, program directors, student services directors, career directors, individual students, instructors, and teacher assistants (TAs).

* The first `40` minutes of class consists of introductions from the following:

   * Student Success Managers (SSMs) and potential university staff, program directors, student services director, career directors.

   * Individual students.

   * Teacher Assistants (TAs).

   * Instructors.

* The SSM, university, and career staff will most likely present their own introductions based on their respective department criteria.

* When introducing the TAs as well as yourself (the instructor), feel free to talk about topics such as:

  * What is your career history? Where did you start and where are you now?

  * What have you accomplished in the past? What is your FinTech industry experience (if applicable)?

  * What drew you to become a instructor/TA? What are you looking forward to in this course?

  * What's something that defines you? What are your passions?

### 2. Instructor Do: The Rise of FinTech (10 mins)

In this activity, the instructor should engage students with a facilitated discussion on FinTech and why it has become so prevalent today.

**File:** [slideshow-placeholder]()

Use the slides to help guide your discussion, and in doing so point out the following:

  * Recent technological advancements in (big) data and mobile network infrastructure has lead to a consumer desire for companies to not only provide more efficent (data-driven) services but also quality engagement through scalable mobile platforms.

  * Due to the changing consumer landscape, large financial firms who have been traditionally slower to adopt newer technologies have been forced to make larger investments in technology to keep up with consumer demand.

  * Market analysis shows that global FinTech investment has grown dramatically in recent years.

  * As a result, there is a growing demand for technical specialists that have the backgrounds and experiences to navigate financial waters.

As you are discussing these slides, look for opportunities to engage students into thoughtful reflection. Use the Socratic method to encourage students to offer their opinions aloud before revealing your own answer. 

For example, ask students to share their own examples of an innovative FinTech company they've heard about and how it's disrupting the financial services industry.

### 3. Instructor Do: Defining Fintech (20 mins)

In this activity, the instructor discusses the exact nature of what the key word *FinTech* entails.

Present to the class the following questions and answers:

  * What exactly *is* FinTech?

    * **Answer:** Generally, as the term suggests, FinTech is the combination of finance and technology. More specifically, however, FinTech refers to the financial services industry that has been disrupted by technological innovation that aims to compete with traditional financial methods and improve activities or inefficiencies in finance.

  * What defines a FinTech company?

    * **Answer:** A FinTech company is a financial services company that seeks to utilize technology to drive more efficient operation, either through backend network infrastructure or consumer engagement. Market analysis more broadly categorizes FinTech companies as falling in one of the following groups: *infrastructure providers*, *large technology ecosystems*, *new entrants/start-ups*, and *incumbent financial institutions*.

  * Why has FinTech become so important?

    * **Answer:** Rapid advancements in technology have bolstered the ability for smaller companies to innovate and disrupt many traditional financial domains. Thus, larger and traditional finance firms have been forced to compete and upgrade their own technologies, thereby creating technological demand and a need for skilled technical workers.

  * What kind of careers are to be expected in FinTech?

    * **Answer:** Because FinTech is just the implementation of technology within the financial domain, FinTech careers are largely similar to that of the IT industry. It's quite common to see general data analyst, data/software engineer, and data scientist roles; however, these roles may be more specifically named as quantitative analysts/traders or portfolio analysts, for example.

### 4. Instructor Do: Course Overview (10 mins)

In this activity, the instructor should overview the topics and technologies used in the course as well the timeline for each topic or unit. 

**File:** [slideshow-placeholder]()

Continuing in the slideshow, walk through the following narrative about the course agenda and timeline:

  * `Weeks 1-2`: Students are introduced to the world of FinTech and will discuss the current financial landscape. Then, they will dive into the financial modeling methods of the current industry-standard tool, Microsoft Excel.

  * `Weeks 3-7`: While useful and easy to grasp, Excel, however, is limited in its technical capabilities compared to a full-fledged progamming langauge such as Python. Thus, over the next several weeks, students will cover the basics of Python as well as how to use additional libraries/tools such as Pandas, APIs, Plotly, and SQL databases, in the context of financial analysis.

  * `Weeks 8-9`: Students are tasked with their first project.

  * `Weeks 10-14`: Companies are becoming more and more data-driven in their decision making. Therefore, through machine learning, students will need to learn how to not only interpret and create financial models, but also how to automate the execution of such models. Topics include algorithmic trading, robo-advisory, insurance, risk management, and regtech-related technologies.

  * `Weeks 15-16`: Students are tasked with their second project.

  * `Weeks 17-21`: With its benefits of security, speed, and decentralized peer-to-peer validation, Blockchain technology has already become more efficient than tradtional finance in the context of transactions and third-party validation. Thus, students will learn about Blockchain fundamentals, smart contracts using Solidity, and how to develop Blockchain applications on the popular Ethereum blockchain network.

  * `Week 22`: Reserved for additional topics specific to each university partner.

  * `Weeks 23-24:` Students are tasked with their final project.

### 5. Instructor Do: Tips (10 mins)

In this activity, the instructor should provide students some encouragement and tips for overcoming the mental frustrations they will more than likely face throughout the course. 

**File:** [slideshow-placeholder]()

Open the next series of slides and emphasize the following points: 

  * Having a humble attitude is the first requirement of being successful in this program. In a way, students should channel their inner toddler and recognize that "knowing nothing" and admitting such will allow them to dig their heels in and invest the time necessary to succeed. In a way, being in this program will be like nothing else these students have attempted to do. Their mastery of other subjects, their educational backgrounds, and their professional successes do not guarantee that they will do well here. The only thing that will guarantee success is hard work, humility, and a relentless desire to be better. Recognizing how little you know is a first step towards creating that urgency.

  * Learning all the skills in this course will feel tough, intimidating, and frustrating at times. Students should immediately forget about their uncle/brother-in-law/friend/step-sister who told them about so-and-so learning to hack in `1` week. Becoming a skilled professional is challenging and will take time. There is no way around that.

  * Because of how hard this course can be, there will be many moments where students will doubt themselves. However, students should know that everyone starts as a beginner, even the instructor himself/herself. In addition, students were enrolled in this program because they were screened and determined to have what it takes to complete the course -- so have faith! 

  * Due to the length of the program, psychological burnout *will* come up during the course of the program. The idealism and can-do attitude students enter with on Day `1` will be challenged over time as activities and topics become more intense. Therefore, students should see each other as a family embarking on a long and difficult journey together, and should support each other when times get tough.

  * Lastly, learning is supposed to be frustrating! It's a process, and no matter what stick with it! Things only get easier when we choose to embrace the difficulty.

### 6. BREAK (15 mins)

---

### 7. Student Do: FinTech and Me (20 mins)

In this activity, students now get a chance to take some time and break off into groups of `3-4` to discuss amongst themselves what FinTech means to them.

**File:** [README.md](Activities/01-Stu_FinTech_Group_Discussions/README.md)

### 8. Instructor Do: Review FinTech and Me (10 mins)

* Give each group `2-3` minutes to orally present their findings.

* Once all groups have presented, tie everything back together by explaining that FinTech is the implementation of technology to the finance industry, but what it *means* to each individual person can differ. Some see FinTech as a way to upgrade their current skills and be more employer marketable; some see FinTech as a way to solve the inefficiencies in their current finance role; others see FinTech as a path to embarking on a new career supported by growing demand. 

* Despite students' differing reasons for wanting to learn more about FinTech, every student has made the leap to take this course. Therefore, encourage students to continue to get to know each other as they'll be "together in the trenches" for the next `26` weeks and could serve as valuable network connections after the completion of the course.

### 9. Student Do: Group Thought Experiment (25 mins)

In this activity, students will once again break off into groups of `3-4` to devise a solution to a traditional finance problem that FinTech has come to solve. This group thought experiment should put students in the mindset of how technology has been applied to bolster the financial services industry.

**File:** [README.md](Activities/02-Stu_FinTech_Thought_Experiment/README.md)

### 10. Instructor Do: Review Group Thought Exeriment  (10 mins)

---

### 11. Instructor Do: Introduce Homework (10 mins)

In this activity, the instructor will go over the unit `1` homework and define its requirements.

Before heading out for the night, introduce the unit `1` homework assignment in which students will have to develop a case study around a particular FinTech company or technology. Students should look to answer as many of the following questions as they can:

* Company Sector:
  
  * Which financial industry it is in?

  * Trends and competitors in this industry; 

* Company Business Activities:
  
  * What “problem” does this company solve?
  
  * Who is their intended customer?
  
  * What solution does this company offer that their competitor does not or cannot? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
  
  * Which technologies are they currently using and how are they implementing them?
  
  * What are they doing right? What could be improved? 
  
* Recommendations:
  
  * If you were to advise them – what products or services would you suggest they add to their  services (whether another company already has  them or something that is your pure imagination)?
  
  * Why do you think it would benefit them? 
  
  * What technologies would your proposed ideas incorporate? Why are those technologies  appropriate for your solution?

Ask the students if they have any remaining questions before ending the class.
