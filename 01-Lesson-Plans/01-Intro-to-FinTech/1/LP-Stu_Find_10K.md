### Student Do: Find a 10-K using EDGAR (10 mins)

* Explain that publicly-traded U.S.-based companies are required to file reports on their financial health several times per year. By law, these companies must file quarterly reports at least three times a year - known as a 10Q, and an annual report at the end of their reporting period known as a 10-K. These documents are important for financial analysts because they afford us a window into financial health of a company. These 10-K's and 10Q's are accessible through the SEC website on a system known as EDGAR.

* Demonstrate for students how to find a 10-K for a company on the [SEC EDGAR website.](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html)

    * Navigagte to the EDGAR website - you can simply google "EDGAR" and it should be the first non-ad site.

    * In the "Fast Search" box, type in the ticker symbol for a company (might we suggest TXN?) and hit enter.

    * Look down the "Filings" column for an instance of "10-K"

    * In the same row, hit "Documents" just to the right

    * On the new page, look for "10-K" in the "Description" column, and then hit the .htm link in the Document column. 

* Explain to students that in this course we would like to use the .htm/.html document because it is more easily read by code we will write later, and can we can use the 10-K to detect the sentiment (feelings) discussed in certain sections of the document.

* Now, it's the students' turn! Challenge them to find a 10-K for their favorite brand of car, or anything they desire!

* For those that finish quickly, what are some other kinds of documents you can pull from EDGAR? What useful information can you retrieve from them? Is it information you can make investment decisions about?

### Instructor Review: Find a 10-K using EDGAR (10 mins)

* By now, most of your students should have been able to find at least one company's filing. This is a good time to begin facilitating a discussion about the documents themselves. Great questions to ask to get started: 

    * What companies did you look up?

    * What interested you about the company you looked up?

    * What _exactly_ can I find out about a company from their 10-K?

    * What sections are there to the document? If I didn't know, where could I go to find out quickly? (Answer: Google it!)

    * Companies often offer up a "earnings guidance" - the company's take on where their earnings will be in the next quarter. Can these be trusted? How can we validate the guidance?
        * Great time to drop the acronym SWAG - **S**ystematic, but **W**e're **A**ll **G**uessing. We make models and take the best, most educated guess we can at getting it right, but ultimately everything is probabalistic.
