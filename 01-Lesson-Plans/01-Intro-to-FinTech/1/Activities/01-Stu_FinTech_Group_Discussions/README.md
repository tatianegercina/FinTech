## FinTech Group Discussions

Time to stretch your legs! So far the day has all been about course introductions and lectures. Now it's time for you and your group to answer the question, what does *FinTech* mean to you?

### Instructions

Walk through the following steps.

* Formulate groups of `3-4` individuals.

* Answer the following questions:

  * What does FinTech mean to you?

  * What about FinTech interests you?

  * Why choose this FinTech course over another course like Data Viz?

  * What are some notable FinTech companies?

* Be prepared to do a quick `2-3` oral presentation to the class on your group's response. 

### Hint

Get to know your fellow classmates! Everyone here is in the same boat and likely has similar desires and interests of looking to excel their career or embark on a new life path; don't be a stranger!
