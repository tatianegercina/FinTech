# Lending Thought Experiment

Traditionally, individuals looking to get a loan would need to apply for a loan at a bank or through a private lender. If the individual met the specific financial institution's loan eligibility criteria––such as credit score, annual income, credit utilization, etc.––they would be approved for the loan and subsequently receive their requested funds. Otherwise, the individual would be denied and therefore receive no loan. 

Often, this meant that individuals with low credit scores and annual incomes would be denied loans, creating a social problem: these individuals represent the population that are usually in need of loans the most. Furthermore, having to request loans from only a handful of banks and private lenders meant that there were similar loan eligibility requirements and little competition among loan interest rates, giving individuals in need few choices.

Given today's mobile phone ubiquity among consumers, how might traditional lending be bolstered by the fact that there is an enormous pool of consumers that can be targeted via mobile applications? This is the main question you'll be reflecting on in this activity. 

## Instructions

Work in groups of 2 to 4 to answer the following questions: 

* How could a lending application potentially disrupt the traditional lending space?

* What would the lending application have to do in order to achieve the following? 

  * Create more competition among loan interest rates. 

  * Target a wider population demographic and allow for broader tolerances of loan eligibility requirements.

Be prepared to do a quick 2- to 3-minute oral presentation to the class on your group's responses. 

## Hint

Think about the power of networks through mobile infrastructure and peer-to-peer interactions. Remember, not everyone in the world is looking to borrow funds; some are looking to make money through lending.
