### Student Do: Discuss Definitions of Fintech


* Students are all here for a course on fintech, but may not have clarity on what exactly that is.

* Slack out (or simply speak the following assignment):

```md
    - You're all here for a course on fintech, but what exactly _is_ fintech?

    - Take the next few minutes to discuss with those around you about what you think fintech both _is_ and _isn't_.

```
