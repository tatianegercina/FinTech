### 8. Course overview

* Continuing in the slideshow, we will now enumerate the topics that will be covered throughout the course.

* Walking students through our narrative:
    * We begin with an introduction to FinTech and Finance as it currently stands, discussing the current financial landscape and some of the current industry-standard methods/tools such as excel.

    * Then, we move into the direction where the industry is *going* by jumping into Python. We'll spend several weeks covering the basics of the languags and popular modern libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib before turning our sights on building predictive time series analyses. This will culminate in our first major project using what we've learned up until now to build the best portfolio strategy possible.

    * From there, we'll supercharge the financial models that we are building using everyone's favorite buzzword: Machine Learning. We'll spend about a week on the introductor material and then get into applications in financial advising, algorithmic trading, and dynamic pricing.

    * In the last major leg of the journey, we'll dive into the oft-misunderstood world of blockchain and cryptocurrencies in order to understand the inefficiencies that they can potentially solve as well as how to develop automatically-executing smart contracts using the Solidity platform.

* If you finish this ahead of schedule, feel free to take one or two questions, but don't get bogged down.
    * Students will often like to ask if we will cover "X" technology. If you know for certain that we will then feel free to answer, otherwise it is a good idea to deflect to office hours so that you can look through the curriculum for an exact answer or offer to help the find resources when they reach an appropriate point in the course.
