* Open the [slideshow](). Use it as a guide for the rest of the lesson. Remember to stay on schedule, and, if necessary, ask your TAs to help keep track of time.

* Have every student in class introduce themselves. Feel free to refer to the slides or come up with questions of your own. Try to keep things lighthearted as students share their backgrounds.

* When all students have had a chance to introduce themselves, have the TAs introduce themselves as well.

* Finally, introduce yourself and showcase a project or two to demonstrate your chops in the data field.
