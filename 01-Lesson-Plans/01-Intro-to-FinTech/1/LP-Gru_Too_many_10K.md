### 11. Group Do: Too many 10-K's!! (20 mins) [Optional]

* This is a group activity, so if students are not already sitting at tables that allow for easy grouping, it's a good idea to stop for a moment and form random groups.

* In the previous activity, we discussed how we could find the 10-K for a company, which is par for the course when starting a financial model. However, what if we needed to pull the filings for _several_ comapanies? An entire sector? Several interrelated sectors?

* With their groups, students should attempt to design a methodology for producing financial models for many companies at once. For reference, they should consider a scenario in which they are tasked with building financial models for 100 companies every quarter. Accuracy is only of moderate importance as the models will be handed off to a secondary team of analysts for validation and correction after the models are completed. Their quarterly resources are a team of three financial analysts and a budget of $50, with a time limit of 12 hours.

### Instructor Do: Review Too many 10-K's!

* In this review, the instructor should mediate a conversation between groups, picking a few to present their ideas and a few to critique or improve on a different group's idea. 

* Great solutions to this problem involve programatically iterating through the EDGAR webpage and either scraping information or downloading the data files.
