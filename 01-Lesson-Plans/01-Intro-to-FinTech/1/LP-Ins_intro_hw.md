### Instructor Do: Introduce Homework [CRITICAL]

* Before heading out for the night, make sure to introduce the first homework assignment so students can begin thinking about what company they want to do their case study on.

* This week's homework has students researching a contemporary FinTech company and developing a case study around it. They should strive to answer as many as possible of the following questions:

    * Current landscape in company sector:
        * Which financial industry it is in?
        * Trends and competitors in this industry; 
    * Company’s business activities
        * What “problem” does this company solve?
        * Who is their intended customer?
        * What solution does this company offer that their competitor does not or cannot? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
    * Which technologies are they currently using and how are they implementing them?
    * What are they doing right? What could be improved? 
    * If you were to advise them – what products or  services would you suggest they add to their  services (whether another company already has  them or something that is your pure imagination)?
    * Why do you think it would benefit them? 
    * What technologies would your proposed ideas  incorporate? Why are those technologies  appropriate for your solution?

    * At the end of the week, students will produce a short, **informal** (5 min) presentation that will lead to a larger discussion with the class on 1.3 and a final report next week.
