## Blockchain and Logistics

* The idea behind using a blockchain for supply chain tracking is essentially creating a provable historical record for each logistical step in from producer to consumer.

* A unique token can be created to represent an asset, in this case, an Alpaca. Upon each transfer of the Alpaca, the token that represents it can be updated to reflect events such custody transfer, ownership transfer, or reflecting the transport of the Alpaca from location A to B.

* The consumer can then represent ownership of the asset by owning the unique token. At any point in time, the consumer (or anyone for that matter) can validate the events that led to the final purchase of the Alpaca, and any future metadata regarding the Alpaca.

* This concept of tokenization can be applied to any physical or digital asset as a means of representing it digitally in a highly secure fashion.

## Cross-Border and Localized Payments

* Since no single party manages the blockchain, geographical borders become irrelevant.

* Once you have crypto, you can send it anywhere around the world within minutes without needing to go through traditional banking infrastructure.

* Stablecoins are a way of representing fiat (government) currency in cryptocurrency form. This allows individuals who do not have access to banking systems to participate in the global economy without the higher volatility of other cryptocurrencies. It also allows for transferring this value quickly without middlemen, allowing for fast transaction finality (settlement).

## Mobile and Online Merchants

* Since all you need to participate in a blockchain is a device with an internet connection, crypto is a great way for ad-hoc and online merchants.

* Anyone, anywhere, can use their mobile phone to create a wallet they can receive payment on. This means that merchants can do away with third party services like Square, and can take the payments directly.

* This makes complex financial infrastructure available to practically anyone.

* Countries like Kenya, Tanzania, India, Lesotho, DRC, Ghana, Mozambique, Egypt already use a purely mobile form of cash, called "M-Pesa" where they transact via text messages.

* Blockchain provides a far more secure and stable system as an alternative.
