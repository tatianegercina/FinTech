# CA Macroeconomics

## Introduction

* In this activity, you will use the Hodrick-Prescott filter to examine macroeconomic trends in Canada between 2004 and 2010.

## Instructions

1. Read the csv GDP data and set the `DATE` column as a datetime index.

2. Plot the raw GDP data as a line plot.

3. Use the `hpfilter` function to decompose the GDP column into the trend and noise components.

4. Plot the GDP trend data as a line plot.

5. Plot the GDP noise as a line plot.

6. Repeat the processes for inflation (keyword `INFLATION_RATE`) and employment (keyword `EMPLOYMENT_RATE`).

7. For at least one of these data sets, plot the exponentially-weighted moving averages. How do the results compare to results of the H-P filter?
