# Regression Metrics

## Instructions

In this activity, you will continue to work with the oil futures data. A starter notebook is provided for you, in which a linear regression model is created, and the predicted values generated. 

Your task is to compute the metrics, and to assess your findings.

Provide and interpret the following metrics:

  * R2 score

  * Mean squared error

  * Root mean squared error

  * Standard deviation of futures return

  * A bar chart of the coefficients by week can be helpful in providing a bird's-eye-view of cyclic patterns. Use the starter code to create a bar chart of coefficients for the weeks of the year.
