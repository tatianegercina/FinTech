# A Rolling Average Gathers No Moss

## Instructions

* In this activity, you will use moving average (MA) and exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) to identify the trend of a financial data set.

* iShares Core S&P 500 (IVV) is an Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF), or a basket of securities (such as stocks and bonds) that tracks the S&P 500.

* Read the data set into pandas as a time series and plot the following:

  * A line chart of the closing price.

  * A moving average chart in which each data point is the average of the closing price of the preceding two weeks of market activity (10 days).

  * Exponentially-weighted moving average charts with half-lives of 10 and 40 days, respectively.

* What trends do you notice? Which plot best reveals the trend?

* If time allows, try also plotting the closing price after resampling it as a weekly average.
