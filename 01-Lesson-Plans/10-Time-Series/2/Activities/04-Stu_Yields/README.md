# Yields

## Instructions

You have been given a dataset on [yields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yield_(finance)). Your task is to create an ARMA model of the data.

1. First, you'll need to determine whether the time series is stationary. Does the plot suggest stationarity? If it is non-stationary, make the necessary transformations.

2. Next, create ACF and PACF plots. Can either plot be used to determine the lag to use for the ARMA model?

3. Finally, create an ARMA model and note its p-value for the lags, as well as AIC and BIC. The order of the model should be p=1, q=1. Plot the predicted values for the next five (business) days.
