# An ARIMA and a Leg

## Instructions

In this activity, you will use an ARIMA model to forecast oil futures prices.

1. Use ACF and PACF plots, as well as AIC and BIC, to estimate the correct number of lags (order) for the model.

2. Create an ARIMA model of the oil futures settle daily prices.

3. Plot a forecast of oil futures settle prices for the next 10 days.

4. Time permitting, test a second model using a different lag value for the model order to see if it has any effect.
