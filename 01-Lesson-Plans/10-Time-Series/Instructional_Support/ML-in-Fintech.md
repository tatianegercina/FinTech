## Machine Learning in  Fintech Today

Machine learning is the backbone of the majority of fintech business models. This is because large amounts of data and fast, cheap decisions about what to do with that data underpin a lot of the value proposition that fintech firms can offer. And the fast, cheap analysis of lots of data is the specialized purview of the field of machine learning (ML). 

Therefore, students will get the *why*, *where*, and *how* of ML. *Why*, because they (and you) will want to know more about why it’s being commonly deployed in the industry, and therefore a relevant skill for their careers. Similarly, they’ll want to know the *where* because knowing of fintechs that do ML will sharpen up their industry awareness. Last, but most important, they’ll learn *how* to do ML, with lots of chances to write python code to build these models and make predictions.


## The Why: Why ML is so Essential for Fintech

The applications for machine learning are wide. They run the gamut from the textual analysis of fraudulent contracts, to determining interest rates and [whether to lend on](https://blogs.thomsonreuters.com/answerson/sofis-data-science-head-opening-the-funnel-to-non-traditional-borrowers-with-machine-learning/) loans, to automated trading models. Below is a brief discussion of some of these applications where ML is being used heavily. 

One interesting use is in replacing the traditional financial advisor with artificial intelligence (AI). [Wealthfront](https://www.wealthfront.com/methodology), [Betterment](https://www.betterment.com/category/engineering/), and [SoFi](https://www.sofi.com/learn/content/what-is-an-automated-advisor/) ("Social Finance") are FinTech examples that automate part or all of the process for saving for retirement. Using ML to recommend tailored portfolios and manage the whole process means that customers no longer have to pay high annual fees to such traditional advisors. (And after all, millennials and later generations [would rather talk to a screen](https://tearsheet.co/future-of-investing/our-clientele-pay-us-not-to-talk-to-them-wealthfront-ceo-andy-rachleff-on-why-robos-dont-need-humans/) than a person when it comes to their finances). 

This automation to reduce costs is not isolated to fintech products oriented towards end-users, like individuals saving for retirement. JP Morgan, for example, has [written a program called COIN](https://digital.hbs.edu/platform-rctom/submission/jp-morgan-coin-a-banks-side-project-spells-disruption-for-the-legal-industry/
), which uses NLP to automatically run due diligence on all of its commercial credit contract agreements. These lines of code have compressed what previously was 360,000 hours of work done by humans into seconds. 

Sometimes, what really matters is the *combination* of natural language processing, or NLP, and the pattern recognition abilities of various other ML algorithms, like Random Forests (in these units, we'll learn how to do both of these). 

Insurance companies, for example, attempt to lower cost by [putting NLP-driven chatbots into the insurance claim process](https://www.spixii.com/success-stories/zurich-case-study), so that the long process of filing a claim, presenting evidence via uploaded photos, and settling payments are done largely without the help of a specialist “claims adjuster”. Yet along with the chatbots, ML is used throughout this process to flag potentially fraudulent claims or a dissatisfied customer.

Consider again fintech’s role in dispensing financial advice and overseeing savings. NLP can replace the (traditionally human) financial advisor by asking questions pertaining to tolerated risk, ability to save, or when they want to retire. For  banks looking to automate the above, [they’d likely involve an NLP chatbot](https://medium.com/botique-ai/conversational-banking-chatbots-the-future-of-banks-in-the-age-of-digital-disruption-3f776a0d3ad3) to extract the above answers from the potential customer, and another machine learning model (Random Forests, KNN, or a DNN) behind the scenes. This latter model would correlate data on the bank’s past customers with the various financial products those customers primarily chose. The bank would then [use that ML model to infer those statistical relationships](https://www.bbva.com/en/machine-learning-how-its-used-in-banking/). The NLP chatbot would then use those findings in order to allow it to inform new customers about what types of financial products they might be interested in.

Moreover, NLP  in Fintech can get quite sophisticated. For example, consier the level of NLP behind these two fintechs, [Alphasense](https://www.alpha-sense.com/) and [DataMinr](https://www.dataminr.com/). Essentially, these are global news monitoring API's, subscribed to by large asset managers and banks in order to help them track relevant risk related information. The two firms get paid in order to (algorithmically) conduct real-time monitoring and textual analysis of *everything* written about *any* firm. Sources are disparate, ranging from financial filings, tweets, press releases, investor conferences, regulatory filings.  Imagine, for example, how valuable it would be for a hedge fund that could monitor, real-time, different drug companies; perhaps whether they’ve just filed FDA results, presented findings at a conference, or published financial information with the SEC. The financial advantage to faster information is enormous, and is one reason why [DataMinr alone](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/dataminr#section-overview) is worth more than $1 billion.

On that point, let’s not forget the scope for applying ML models to forecast financial market results. These forecasts range from loan evaluation (e.g., predicting default rates on bonds or consumer loans) to high-frequency algorithmic trading in the stock market. 

Algorithmic trading driven by statistical models is not necessarily new— the quant hedge fund known as [TwoSigma](https://twosigmasecurities.com/), for example, automatically trades more than 300 million shares a day (or about one share for every person in the U.S., per day). The fund has been in the business since the early 2000’s. However, within the last 5 years, algorithmic trading—including of the variety driven by decisions involving ML—now accounts for [between 75% to 90%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_trading_system) of all equity trades in the U.S. What's more, perhaps in part by thier purely virtual beginnings, more cryptocurrency exchanges and trading firms are looking for individuals that can write ML code that trades profitably. 

Outside of the equity market, ML is used to classify good lending decisions from bad. This can take the form of algorithmic hedge funds that trade bonds, but more commonly involves the instant and automated assessment of the quality of a potential loan. From credit whales like [Wells Fargo](https://databricks.com/session/productionizing-credit-risk-analytics-with-lstm-tensorspark-a-wells-fargo-case-study) to smaller peer-to-peer players like [LendingClub](https://blog.lendingclub.com/lendingclubs-next-generation-credit-model/), ML algorithms—-and not loan officers-—are what decides who gets a loan and on what terms (e.g., maturity, interest rate). The gist behind this application of ML models is that they correlate data on past customer charateristics and payment history to find (and thus predict) the patterns that lead to non-payment (default). With better and cheaper predictions, the end result is a lower loss rate to the lender, and ultimately lower rates overall to borrowers.

In closing, the use of ML in fintech is, frankly, wider than one instructor guide can allow. Other uses not already mentioned above include firms [built to identify money laundering](https://www.conpend.com/trafinas/) or sanctions violations, satellite recognition for real-time awareness of trading opportunities in commodities, and the prediction of customer churn in financial products. Even the [venture capital](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/a-machine-learning-approach-to-venture-capital)  and [private equity](https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/data-analytics-slowly-transforming-private-equity/
) industries have begun to experiment with ML models to predict the likelihood of start-up success. As long as there is something to automate or something to predict, ML is there. The potential applications are vast.


## The Where: Fintechs That Use ML (and the Skills They’re Hiring for)

In addition to the firms mentioned above, here are a few examples of fintechs doing primarily ML. There are thousands more listed at Crunchbase if you'd like to dig into it more.

* [Sift](https://www.sift.com/), with Crunchbase funding of [106 million](https://sift.com/https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sift-science#section-overview):
  * Founded in 2011, this fintech supplies ML algorithms that can predict and thus prevent detrimental transactions like fake account signups, stolen credit cards, and other scams. Basically, the firm’s ML models take datasets filled with users’ browser and internet protocal (IP) data across multiple websites, along with thousands of other characteristics, and use that data to “separate good orders and customers and transactions from bad” (e.g., by preventing chargebacks, customers with a history of blocked accounts, etc.). Customers that buy their models range from transaction processors as big as Jet (owned by Wal-mart) and AirBnB, to companies that are sensitive to a lot of fraud via natural language, like Twitter and Twilio (a developer backend for language processing in apps).
	
  * Sample Jobs include:
    *   A Senior Solutions Engineer, which “involves understanding the nuances of [customers] machine learning model, and meticulously whiteboarding the flow of their data” as well as
 “writing scripts to build internal tools (For example: Bash scripting, Python, Ruby) and comfort with API)"
    * A Support Engineer, who has “experience using APIs, or a strong understanding of API based products” as well as “proficiency in Python, Ruby, or other scripting languages”.

* [States Title](https://statestitle.com/), an "insurtech" firm with Crunchbase funding of [106.6M](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/states-title#section-overview)
    * In what is normally an industry that is sizable ($25 billion), but rather staid and paperwork driven (real estate title insurance), this firm is shaking things up by applying machine learning models for the detection and understanding of written language, known as natural language processing, or “NLP”. Specifically, this “insurtech” firm  automates a lot of paperwork surrounding real estate transactions, and uses ML to spot potential human mistakes in the process. (It’s confident enough in the uniqueness of its application of ML that its actually [patented the process](https://statestitle.com/resource/states-title-awarded-machine-intelligence-patent/). 

	* Sample [Jobs](https://statestitle.com/team-careers/) include:
    
      *   A Data Engineer that will “definitely have: Experience with scripting languages, particularly Python. Experience with cloud services, particularly Azure”, and “might even have familiarity with ML concepts (supervised learning, feature engineering, etc) and experience with ML frameworks (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, SparkML, etc).” 
          * By the end of these units, students will have plenty of opportunity to write python code and deploy these some of these ML frameworks mentioned to cloud services (including Microsoft’s Azure, but also Google Cloud and Amazon AWS).

      *  A Data Analyst that will “contribute to data analytics, business intelligence, or data science projects”, and have the “Ability to write complex SQL joins” as well as “analyze complex datasets, particularly with Python”.
* [FundBox](https://fundbox.com/), a B2B fintech with Crunchbase funding of [433.5M]( https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/fundbox
):

  * This firm is a “B2B” firm, meaning it sells its products directly to other businesses. Therefore it’s not a household name. Despite that, it’s raised nearly a half billion dollars in venture capital. 

  * Business typically pay each other after 30 days, not immediately like a normal consumer transaction, such as a person buying groceries at a grocery store. Yet, small business typically don’t want to wait that long to receive their money: if they have their money earlier, they can buy new raw material, pay bills, and generally put it to work more quickly. Fundbox therefore lends money to small to medium businesses (SMB's) in a process known as “factoring”. 

  * Factoring, which is when firms get loans backed by sales already made but not yet collected on (“accounts receivables”), is an industry that’s as old as money itself. Because of the thicket of regulation though, Fundbox doesn’t actually make the loans themselves. Like many fintech lenders, Fundbox itself is more of an intermediary; it contracts with an underlying bank (typically a small one, such as the approximately 5,700 credit unions in the U.S.) when it comes time to supply the money to the customer, taking a fee along the way for its matchmaking and credit evaluating service. 

  * As for machine learning, the firm builds proprietary machine learning models to predict the individual credit risk of those firms which apply for money to borrow. Because of the predictive accuracy of their models, the firm can offer businesses lower interest rates for loans, without experiencing higher defaults. 

  * Sample [jobs](https://statestitle.com/team-careers/) include:

    * A senior credit analyst that will have “Strong technical skills - SQL and/or other databases, R/Python, Excel modeling/VBA”, in order to “Work closely with Data Scientists to leverage new risk models in underwriting”  

    *  A fraud analyst who can “research independently“, with “SQL/Python knowledge an advantage”
    
    * A data analyst that will “translate the wealth of data into actionable insights and strategies”, with “experience working w. SQL and/or other databases” and  “Familiarity with R / Python a plus”.
