# Linear Regression

In this activity, you will attempt to identify whether a linear relationship exists between housing sales prices and total square footage.

## Instructions

1. Read the CSV file into Pandas.

2. Create a scatter plot of the total square feet vs. the house sale price.

3. Create a linear regression model using Scikit-learn.

4. Fit the model to the data.

5. Make predictions and save the results in a variable called `predicted_y_values`.

6. Plot the line of best fit along with the data (see starter code for instructions).

7. Obtain the slope and the y-intercept, and r-square values of the model.
