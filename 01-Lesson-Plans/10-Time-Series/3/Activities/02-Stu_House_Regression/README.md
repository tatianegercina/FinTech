# Linear Regression

In this activity, you will attempt to identify whether a linear relationship exists between the total square feet in houses and their housing sale prices.

## Instructions

* Read the CSV file into Pandas.

* Create a scatter plot of the total square feet vs. the house sale price.

* Create a linear regression model using Scikit-learn.

* Fit the model to the data.

* Make predictions and save the results in a variable called `predicted_y_values`.

* Plot the line of best fit along with the data (see starter code for instructions).

* Obtain the slope and the y-intercept, and r-square values of the model.
