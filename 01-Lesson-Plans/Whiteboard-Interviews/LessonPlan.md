## Whiteboard Interviews Lesson Plan - Practice Makes Perfect!

### Overview

Today's workshop is an opportunity for students to review and practice technical interview guidelines in a peer review setting.

### Class Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Verbalize and exercise methods for problem-solving strategies.
* Map out the guidelines on effectively articulating their problem solving process.
* Gain experience from practicing the aforementioned strategies and guidelines.
* Reflect on their shortcomings and devise improvements to the solutions they develop.

### Instructor Notes

* Students should honestly evaluate their partners' performance as well as their own performance via the the [grading rubric]().

* Students should systematically apply the problem solving guidelines with each problem; they can deviate once they've internalized the format, but *not* before.

* Since the only difference between workshops is the selection of interview questions, Instructors are provided a single Time Tracker and abbreviated Lesson Plan.

* Review the interview questions for the workshop ahead of time. These are available in the [Interview Questions](../3-Interview-Qs) repository. You will need one question for each 30 minute interview—partners will *not* work on the same interview problems successively.

* Have your TAs reference the `Workshop Time Tracker` to help keep track of time; more important than the Time Tracker is that students have adequate time to work through interview problems.

### 1. Instructor Do: Welcome Class (5 mins)

In this activity, instructors welcome students to the class and explain that they will be reviewing and practicing technical interview guidelines in a mock peer review setting.

**File:** [Slideshow-Placeholder]()

* Students will overview the problem-solving strategies and as well as the discussion guidelines, and then run their own peer-interviews for the rest of class.

* For the mock peer review sessions, each student will have 25 minutes to work through a problem. Once the 25 minutes is up, students will switch. They have 5 minutes to review feedback with one another before rotating pairs or interview questions.

* Emphasize that the purpose of these workshops is not primarily to find the correct answer to these questions. Rather, it is to train students to take the right *approach* to problem solving. At this stage, following the guidelines matters more than finding the correct solution. This is because excellent communication is one of the most sought-after traits interviewers screen for.

### 2. Instructor Do: Introduce and Review Problem Solving Guidelines (15 mins)

In this activity, instructors will introduce the problem solving guidelines that will help students to effectively outperform in a technical interview.

**Files:**

* [Slideshow-Placeholder]()
* [Problem Solving Guidelines](Activities/01-Ins_Problem_Solving_Guidelines/Solved/TechnicalInterviewGuidelines.pdf)

Open the slideshow and explain the following:

* Students will use the methodologies outlined in the [Problem Solving Guidelines](Activities/01-Ins_Problem_Solving_Guidelines/Solved/TechnicalInterviewGuidelines.pdf) to impress upon a technical interviewer that they are **strong problem solvers.** Specifically, students will use the following technical interview methodologies:

  * Restate/explain the problem with a **concrete example.**
  * Sketch the solution on a high-level (ex. psuedocode).
  * Discuss the approach and any assumptions or shortcomings.
  * Translate and implement the solution into functional code.
  * Discuss the solution's shortcomings and corresponding potential improvements.

* More than anything, interviewers want to know an interviewee's mindset and ability to solve problems, even if he or she does not have the full answer/solution. Therefore, communication is absolutely key to outperforming in *any* interview, not just a technical interview.

* Additionally, it is important to interact and develop a relationship with the interviewer. Not only do interviewers want to know that an individual has the knowledge and capacity to perform their role, but also the personality that fits within their company's culture.

Ask the students if they have any questions before moving on.

### 3. Instructor Do: Introduce Partner Interviews (15 mins)

In this activity, instructors will overview the process of the mock interviews for today's lesson.

**Files:**

* [Slideshow-Placeholder]()
* [Peer Interview Grading Rubric](Activities/01-Ins_Problem_Solving_Guidelines/Solved/PeerTechnicalInterviewRubric.xlsx)

Open the slideshow and explain the following:

* Students will break off into pairs, with one student acting as the interviewer and the other student acting as the interviewee. Students will decide themselves who goes first as the interviewer/interviewee.

* Students will spend 30 minutes for their first round of interviewing and then another 30 minutes for their second round of interviewing (students switch roles).

* Each student will act as both the interviewer and the interviewee in their pair (of two students). Afterwards, there will be a 5 minute session to discuss feedback and potential areas of improvement.

* After each pair of students has gone through the full interview process (acted as both interviewer/interviewee and discussed feedback), students will break off into new pairs and repeat the process until the end of the class.

Then slack out the [Peer Interview Grading Rubric](Activities/01-Ins_Problem_Solving_Guidelines/Solved/PeerTechnicalInterviewRubric.xlsx) and explain the following:

* The rubric will be used by interviewers to assess their corresponding partner's interview performances.

* The rubric includes a score of 0-3 for multiple criteria such as:

  * The interviewee adequately restated the problem.
  * The interviewee asked the interviewer for input and clarification.
  * The interviewee use a logical approach to solving the problem - regardless of a correct solution

### 4. Student Do: First Partner Interviews (30 mins)

In this activity, students will pair off with each other to perform mock interviews, with one student as the interviewer and the other as the interviewee.

**Files:**

* [README.md](Activities/02-Stu_Partner_Interviews/README.md)
* [Interview Questions](Activities/02-Stu_Partner_Interviews/Solved)

Slack out the [README.md](Activities/02-Stu_Partner_Interviews/README.md) and explain the following:

* Now, students should break off into their pairs. They can work with seatmates to start as they'll eventually rotate through the class. Specific student pairs should decide amongst themselves who will first play the role of the interviewer, and who will first play the role of the interviewee.

* Students will have 5 minutes for the interviewer to review the interview question README and solution. Then, the remaining 25 minutes will be allocated for the actual interview.

* Remind students to **systematically implement the problem solving guidelines**.

  * It's okay if they have to refer to them.

  * Explain that they will be free to work in a more "freeform" manner when they've internalized this basic approach.

### 5. Student Do: Second Partner Interviews (30 mins)

In this activity, students will switch roles in their mock interviews; the interviewer becomes the interviewee and vice versa.

* After 25 minutes, instruct partners to swap roles, such that the interviewee now plays the role of interviewer, and vice versa.

* Slack out a new question for the interviewee to work on.

  * Set a timer for 5 minutes, such the interviewer can review the new question.

  * When the five minutes are up, set a timer for 25 minutes, so that students can interview.

* Again, emphasize the importance of implementing the problem solving guidelines to a tee.

---

### 6. Student Do: Trade Feedback (5 mins)

In this activity, students will exchange interview feedback with their partners and discuss how they can improve.

* After 20 minutes, have students trade rubrics and discuss each others' performance.

* This should be mostly positive in tone—have students identify:

  * What their partners did best; and

  * What they should focus on improving during their next interview.

* Encourage students to avoid discussing the solutions at this stage; the important piece is not the answers, but how well students communicated their thought processes.

---

### 7. Student Do: Repeat (Remainder)

In this activity, students break off into new pairs and repeat the procedures outlined in activities 3-5 for the remainder of the class.

* Allow 2 minutes for groups to switch partners, so that each individual works with a new classmate.

  * This can be as simple as one partner shifting seats to the left, and one shifting seats to the right.

* Repeat the procedure outlined in sections **2** through **4** for the remainder of class.

* If the final interview round would run over the end of class, you have two choices:

  * Adjust the time allotments for the final round of interviews to fit class necessary—two 15 minute sessions is acceptable, for instance.

  * Swap roles. Have students choose a question for you to work on, and verbalize your problem solving strategy for them.

    * Alternatively, work through a problem with the class as a whole.

### 8. Conclusion (0:00)

* Slack out the solutions for each interview question students worked on today for later review.

  * Emphasize that the solutions are of secondary importance to adequate communication.
