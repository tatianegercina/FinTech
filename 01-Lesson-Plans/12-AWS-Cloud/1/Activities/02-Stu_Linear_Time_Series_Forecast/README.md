# Training a Machine Learning Model in SageMaker

In the next activity you'll be performing _time series forecasting_ with a SageMaker built-in Linear Learner algorithm.


## Instructions

Using your SageMaker notebook instance, upload the `linear_time_series_forecast.ipynb` notebook to JupyterLab, and walk through the cell steps to create, train and deploy a Linear Learner model and then forecast values.


## Bonus

If time remains, check if you could have solved this same problem using another SageMaker built-in algorithm.

## Hints

* Check the Built-In Algorithms [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sagemaker-algo-docker-registry-paths.html).

* There are at least two algorithms that can work.

* If you need a refresher visit the [JupyterLab Documentation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/interface.html#).
