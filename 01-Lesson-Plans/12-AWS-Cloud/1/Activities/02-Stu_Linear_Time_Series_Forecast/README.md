# Training a Machine Learning Model in SageMaker

In the next activity you'll be performing a _linear regression_ with a SageMaker built-in Linear Learner algorithm.


## Instructions

Using your SageMaker notebook instance, upload the `boston-housing-regression.ipynb` notebook to JupyterLab, and walk through the cell steps to create, train and deploy a Linear Learner model and then forecast values.

Take a look at the SageMaker Linear Learner Algorithm documentation: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/linear-learner.html


## Bonus

If time remains, think about the places in the notebook where advantages of SageMaker where leveraged.

* Go over other Built-In Algorithms in SageMaker [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sagemaker-algo-docker-registry-paths.html).
