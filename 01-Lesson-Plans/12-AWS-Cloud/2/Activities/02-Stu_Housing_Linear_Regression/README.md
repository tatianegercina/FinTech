# Training a Machine Learning Model in SageMaker

In the next activity you'll train and deploy a _linear regression_ model with a dataset and a SageMaker built-in algorithm.

The provided dataset contains Boston house prices. With this you can build a model to predict the price of a house given certain input features.

## Instructions

Using your SageMaker notebook instance, upload the provided `boston-housing-regression.ipynb` notebook to JupyterLab, and walk through the cell steps and add any missing code. The notebook will guide you through the process to create, train and deploy a supervised regression model using the SageMaker's built-in `Linear Learner` algorithm. Once the model is deployed you can forecast prices of homes not included in the dataset and also review the model's performance.

Take a look at the SageMaker Linear Learner Algorithm documentation: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/linear-learner.html


## Bonus

If time remains, think about the places in the notebook where advantages of SageMaker where leveraged.
