# Amazon Web Services Free Tier

Amazon Web Services (AWS) has three types of free offers available depending on the product that you choose: free tier, 12 months free, and trials. The details of each free offer can be found here: [https://aws.amazon.com/free/free-tier/](https://aws.amazon.com/free/free-tier/).

The Amazon SageMaker free trial includes:

* 250 hours per month of `t2.medium` notebook usage for the first two months
* 50 hours per month of `m4.xlarge` for training for the first two months
* 125 hours per month of `m4.xlarge` for hosting for the first two months

At the moment of writing, the activities in this lesson use free tier services or cost less than 10 cents of a dollar, so long as resources are deleted (after being stopped, if required) after use and by the end of class. Follow the instructor's directions in case anything has changed recently given AWS is constantly updating it's offerings and pricing.
