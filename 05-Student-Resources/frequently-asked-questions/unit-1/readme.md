## Unit 01: Intro to Finance and Programming
#### Where can I get started with learning Git?
Start with our pre-work, which has two modules with video tutorials and activities that can help out with the foundations of working with Git:
[Bootcamp Pre-work](https://coding-bootcamp-fintech-prework.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest )

Conveniently, GitHub has their own set of guides to help break down how to use the program:
[GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/)

Additionally, if you find videos helpful in your learning process, this is roughly an hour of video designed to cover the fundamentals of Git and GitHub:

Finally, we have a handy visual Git reference guide located here:

#### Why do I need a virtual environment?
Virtual environments can be compared to different user profiles on one computer.  You might share a computer in your home with your family, but you might not have the same programs installed as your 5 year old son, or the same bookmarked pages as your teenaged daughter.  When you are ready to the use the computer, you simple log in and all your personal settings are there waiting for you.

In a similar way, virtual environments create a personalized space for your project within your computer.  For example, you might be working on a project with your group during project week that needs certain packages that you don't typically need in the everyday course of class.  You would create a virtual environment to download only the packages needed for the project.  Its also possible that during the work for your project you notice that one of the necessary packages doesn't work with Python v3.7 and must be downgraded to Python v3.6.  Because of your virtual environment you won't need to downgrade your Python package across the board, but only for the project you need it on.

Another important reason for using virtual environments is for deployment purposes.  If you have an application you wish to deploy, you wouldn't want to install a bunch of packages it doesn't need to run.  This will slow down the application and cause deployment errors.
