## Unit 02: Python
#### What's the relevance of Python?
Python is the primary language that we will be using in this course. It's a semantic language which makes it easier to read and understand, and the reliance on indentation makes the organized structure quicker to grasp. With this language, we'll be able to dive into a slew of libraries that will make solving complex data problems more simple.

#### What's up with this crazy indentation?
With Python, indentation is more than just organization and readability. Python's functionality actually depends on proper indentation!

In this snippet, we're using indentation to tell our code where our for loops begin and end. In Python, indenting creates blocks of code that work together. Similarly, indenting backwards tells the program when to end a loop.

```python
for x in range(10):
    print(x)

for x in range(20, 30):
    print(x)
```

The code you will write in Python will eventually be seen by someone else. Focusing on organization and readability is important because you want colleagues to be able to read your code. If your code is poorly organized it will be difficult to read later on.

## Unit 04: Pandas
#### When should we use Pandas versus just using Python?
Python is a scripting language, while Pandas is a library that works on top of Python and makes data manipulation easier.

Libraries are pre-written collections of code that make it easier to unlock the capabilities of a programming language. Someone else already did a ton of hard work to create these libraries and make your life easier and your workflow more efficient.

It would be a slog to manually go through all of your data with vanilla Python. Pandas makes this process much quicker.

## Unit 05: APIs
#### How do I differentiate between the client and the server?
The web applications we build in class (and all other web apps) will live on a server, which is basically a gigantic computer or network of computers. When a user goes into their browser and types in an address, the server sends information to the user's computer, or the client.

Basically: Clients request from the server, and the server returns a response.

#### Where can I find more information on how to use these APIs?
Each API is a pre-written set of code that helps you interact with somebody elses information. Every API will come with its own set of documentation, and much like with a library, you will have to dive into it! There should be a developer section on each site that will explain the service and any potential limitations.

Any time we work with an API, it's a good idea to have the documentation ready and refer to it frequently. This is all part of the process when it comes to picking up and familiarizing yourself with new technologies.

## Unit 06: Data Visualization
#### What is the relevance of Data Visualization?
Your stakeholders and clients will typically be much more able to understand your projections and analytics if there are compelling and visually interesting graphics that go along with them. Raw numbers may give information, but taking that data and creating visualizations is what tells a compelling story.
