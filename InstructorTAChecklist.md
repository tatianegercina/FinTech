# Instructor / TA Checklist

Ahoy! Here are some general tips and reminders for what to have done at each point of the week. 

If you have any outstanding questions, check with your SSM or post on the `#05-fintech` Slack channel.

## Beginning of the Week

* Prepare! _Tip: About 1 hour per Lesson Plan is recommended at minimum._

* Review the next homework assignment.

## Before Class Starts

* Do a `git pull` of the [FinTech-Lesson-Plans](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/FinTech-Lesson-Plans) repo.
* Remember to install and initialize [Git LFS](https://coding-bootcamp-instructor-onboarding-prework.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/modules/module11/git/git-lfs/) before you clone the repository for the first time. 

## Beginning of Class

* **Instructors** 

  * Start the Panopto recording. Copy/paste the link into the BCS session and slack out to students. Set "Primary Screen" to "Built-In Display" in order to record your active screen.

  * Open the day's `LessonPlan.md` file on a second display for yourself.

  * Open the entire day's `Activities` folder in your editor to easily move through the examples.

* **TAs**

  * Remind students to mark their attendance in BCS. Edit attendance as needed.

  * Open the day's `LessonPlan.md` file and follow along.

  * Open the `TimeTracker.xlsx` file to help the Instructor keep an eye on time.

## During Class

* **All** instructional team members should be circulating the room and helping out during activities!

* **TAs**

  * Monitor the `TimeTracker.xlsx` file and collaborate with the Instructor to make adjustments to the class schedule if needed.

  * Provide students with `Activities` folder content throughout class.

    * OPTION 1. Slack out activity instructions, solutions, and files.

      * Drag the necessary zipped activity file into Slack's "Message" field. Enter instructions from Lesson Plan or accompanying `ReadMe.md` file into "Add Comment" field.
          
    * OPTION 2. Use the class repo to push/pull content.
    
      * Push the `Unsolved` activities to the class repo before class. 
          
        * Have students `git pull` on their machines.
          
        * Push the `Solved` activities to the class repo after you review together - students can pull!

## After Each Class

* Copy any activities and [download any slides as a PDF](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14MiAunWj30hu-pYLGDz9JOM5XbGjunn1hZ6iyym4w2w/edit?usp=sharing) from the concluded class (main GitHub repo) and paste into the class repo (GitLab/GitHub) on your local machine. Push up your changes.

* Slack out the links from the `VideoGuide.md` file of completed activities, if available.

## End of the Unit

* Provide students with the full `VideoGuide.md` file in their class repo, if available.
